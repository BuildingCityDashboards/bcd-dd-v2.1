                  p Housing in Dublin, and Ireland more generally, is a significant issue and live political debate. This data story examines housing in the capital through the housing and planning data available for the city. There are two things to keep in mind in terms of understanding housing. 
                  p First, it is a complex issue that involves a number of factors and outcomes including housing supply and demand (including homelessness), existing stock and type (social/private/rental, vacancy), house and rental prices, mortgage arrears and negative equity, access to land,  access to credit, planning permissions, homelessness, unfinished estates, land supply and price.
                  p Second, making sense of the present situation requires placing it in historical context. It is possible to make the case that housing in Ireland has been in crisis since the early 1990s and the start of the Celtic Tiger. Consequently, we have structured this data story into three parts corresponding to the 3 phases of the crisis:

                .something
                  p The exact start date of the Celtic Tiger era is still debated, but most analysts accept it was between 1991 and 1995. From the early 1990s the Irish economy began to transform with a growth in economic activity and numbers in employment. As the economy grew, the population increased through immigration and natural increase and average household size shrank through alterations in family structure.  Between April 1991 and April 2006 the population of Ireland increased by 704,129 (20%), the number of households by 440,437 (43%).

                  p The demand for housing thus expanded rapidly, as did the need to produce a more diversified stock that would cater for different sized and types of household.  Population and households expanded very rapidly in the counties surrounding Dublin; for example, in Kildare and Meath the number of households grew by 85% and 87% between 1991-2006.

                  //- p.small.text-center Figure 2: Housing types.
                  p This demand had a number of effects – a construction boom, surge in house prices, a large increase in household and mortgage debt, bank indebtedness, overzoning, urban sprawl and long distance commuting – all of which can be considered a crisis in its own right given its dramatic transformative effect and demands.
                  p Between January 1991 and December 2006 762,631 housing units were completed in Ireland, peaking with 93,419 units being built in 2006 alone.  Between 1994 and 2006, 154,803 housing units were built in the four Dublin authorities and 84,688 three surrounding counties.

                  p More units were being built nationally than there were households being formed, especially in the period 2002-06 (c.296,000<sup>1</sup>  built vs 181,563 households).
                  p Nonetheless, house prices grew dramatically.  The average new house price rose from €78,715 in Dublin and €66,914 for the country as a whole in 1991, to €416,225 in Dublin (a 429% increase) and €322,634 for the country as a whole (a 382% increase) in 2007 (DECLG 2014).  Secondhand homes followed the same trend, with homes in Dublin rising by 551% and 489% outside the capital.

                  //- p.small.text-center Figure 4: Property price growth for Dublin/National.
                  p In the same period house building costs and wages only doubled.  In Q3 1995, the average secondhand house price was 4.1 times the average industrial wage of €18,152; by Q2 2007 secondhand house prices had risen to 11.9 times the average industrial wage of €32,616.<sup>2</sup>   
                  p Not unsurprisingly, the total value of household mortgage debt increased dramatically, from €47.2 billion in 2002 to over €139.8 billion at the end of 2007, with the average size of a new mortgage (€266,000) being nearly double the 2002 figure.<sup>3</sup>

                  //- p.small.text-center Figure 5: Residential mortgage debt.
                  p During this period a ‘bubble economy’, underpinned by the expansion of debt to households based on perceived increases in the value of their homes, drove economic growth.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, given rapidly rising prices and a strong rental market, the buy-to-let market flourished, with a significant number of households becoming ‘amateur’ landlords.  
                  p State investment in social housing was waning whilst demand was growing, with a turn to the private sector to provide accommodation through a rent supplement scheme.  Between 1994 and 2007 47,769 social housing units were built in Ireland, plus between 1999 and 2007 9,378 were acquired through purchase and 1,201 long-term leases acquired through the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS).  At the same time 22,633 local authority units were sold to tenants (many of these funded by mortgages provided by local authorities, a large proportion of which are now in arrears). 
                  p Further, social housing built during the 1950s was coming to the end of its life needing either substantial refurbishment or replacement.

                  p Given the demand for prime land for development, pressure was placed on local authorities to zone more land and the cost of land rose dramatically, especially in 2004-06.  Land prices jumped in value from just under €10,000 per hectare in 1998 to over €58,400 per hectare in 2006.<sup>5</sup>  The result was that land became a significant component of housing cost: up to 50%, against a European average of 10–15%.<sup>6</sup>    
                  p To enable developers to bid for land and to afford the cost of building bank lending increased substantially.  In 2003 the indebtedness of Irish banks to overseas banks was just over 10% of Irish GDP.<sup>7</sup>  By 2008 this had risen to 60% of GDP, with over 60% of bank assets tied up in property-related lending .
                  p Given the cost of land and housing, households who wished to buy a home but who had limited resources were forced to either buy property that did not suit their future needs with the aim of trading up later, borrowing beyond their means (e.g., 100% or interest-only mortgages; or taking out multiple loans), or buying in an area further away and commuting leading to extensive urban sprawl and the growth of smaller towns around the principal cities and towns.

                  p Somewhat ironically, all of these changes were celebrated by the government, the construction sector, and the media during the Celtic Tiger era.  They were taken as a sign that Ireland was catching up with the rest of the developed West in terms of its economy and property sector.  It was suggested that a virtuous circle had been created whereby people stepping onto the property ladder were immediately gaining the benefit in their prime asset rising in price, and moreover they had more choice in housing options than ever before; the government was collecting significant tax revenue (VAT, capital gains tax, stamp duty, development levies) that could be re-invested into improved services and infrastructure; and the property and banking sector were flourishing whilst helping to bring in overseas investment.  Whilst price rises were staggering, potential purchasers and investors were assured that there was still plenty of scope for further expansion.  The worst that could happen naysayers were told was a soft landing, wherein prices levelled off to modest growth, and construction slowed in pace.
