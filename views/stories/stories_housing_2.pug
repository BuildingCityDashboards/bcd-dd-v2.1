                .something
                  p  As the global economy slowed and the global sub-prime banking crisis began house price rises in Ireland started to slow in September 2006, 
                    |levelling off in March 2007, and remaining static until November 2007.  From December 2007 to February 2012 they fell consistently, 
                    |before bottoming out and remaining stable until June 2013.

                  p  From the peak to bottom prices fell by 57.4% in Dublin (houses 55.9% and apartments 63.7%) and 48.7% in the rest of the country. 
                    |Ireland experienced one of the deepest house market collapses on record.
                  p  As 2008 started it was clear that the promise of a soft landing was empty and all of the issues built up over the course of the 
                    |Celtic Tiger years exploded into a new set of crises as the property bubble burst and the Irish banking sector collapsed, 
                    |culminating in the Irish bank guarantee of September 2008, the creation of the state-owned National Assets Management Agency (NAMA) in 
                    |September 2009 (which bought €74 billion of distressed property loans from the Irish banks), and the €85 billion IMF–EU-ECB bailout in November 2010. 
                  p  Whilst the global financial crisis was the trigger to the Irish crisis, Irish banks were little exposed to US subprime loans; 
                    |rather, they were massively exposed to property and development loans in a bubble market.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, it soon became clear that not only were prices over-inflated, 
                    |but that there was a massive oversupply of housing stock and over-zoning of land.
                  p  Between 2005 and 2007 252,403 housing units were completed in Ireland (connected to the electricity grid – see earlier graph), 
                    |with another 78,144 added in 2008 and 2009 as legacy construction slowed. This is despite the fact that the 2002 census had 
                    |reported 177,254 vacant units (excluding holiday homes) and the 2006 census 216,533 vacant units (excluding holiday homes)

                  p.small.text-center Figure 2: Vacant housing 1991-2016.
                  p  Put simply, housing units had been built in excess of demand across the entire country, with several local authorities having vacancy rates excluding holiday homes above 15%. 
                    |The extent of the oversupply was clarified by the 2011 census, which reported that 230,056 units were vacant (excluding holiday homes), 168,427 houses and 61,629 apartments out of a total housing stock of 1,994,845 (11.5% of stock). 
                    |Allowing that one would always expect some units to be vacant in any housing market (c.6%) then oversupply was approximately 110,000 units.
                  p  The most visible manifestation of the oversupply issue were unfinished estates. After some speculation as to how many such estates existed, 
                    |The National Survey of Housing Developments reported that there were 2,846 documented unfinished estates in Ireland, present in every local authority. <sup>2</sup> 
                    |With respect to the units on these estates, 78,195 were complete and occupied, 23,250 complete and vacant, and 19,830 under construction, with planning permission in place for a further 58,025 units.

                .something
                  p  Beyond vacancy and unfinished estates, there has been a concern related to the quality of dwellings constructed during the Celtic Tiger era.  Building control and standards were deregulated in Ireland in 1990, with local authority planning enforcement only undertaking inspections on 10-15% of sites and not at all stages of development. The highest profile case was Priory Hall in Dublin, where 187 apartments were found to breach fire hazard regulations, with residents forced to vacate their homes for two years whilst continuing to pay mortgages, but there have been numerous other similar examples.  
                  p  Further, there are estimated to be in excess of 20,000 homes whose foundation hardcore and building blocks are contaminated with pyrite, though the DECLG presently only recognizes 74 estates containing 12,250 units, predominately located in Dublin City, Fingal, Meath, Kildare, and Offaly.
                  p  In addition to oversupply of dwellings, there was also an oversupply of zoned land and commercial premises.  In June 2008, there was 14,191 hectares of serviced zoned land in the state, enough for up to 462,000 potential new units (DECLG 2016).  In addition, there was another 30,000 hectares of unserviced zoned land.
                //- fig4

                .something
                  p  Not unsurprisingly land prices plummeted by between 75-98% in value post-2007.  In Dublin some 782,500m2 of office space (23%) was vacant in 2010.  After a substantial growth in the construction of hotels during the Celtic Tiger, at the end of 2008 15,000 guest rooms (26%) were deemed to be in-excess of demand. 
                  p  As the housing market plummeted and the wider economy crashed, with unemployment rising from 4.6% in Q4 2007 to peak at 15.1% in Q3 2011 and households facing tax rises and pay cuts, increasing financial pressure was placed onto households (CSO 2014b). (have link to employment graph elsewhere on site?) Faced with paying high payment rates on their mortgages many households struggled to keep up with payments.  In Q3 2009 3.3% of principal residence mortgages were in arrears by more than 90 days.  By Q3 2013 this had peaked at 12.9% (99,189 mortgages), with 18.4% in some level of arrears (141,520) (Central Bank 2016).  
            
                //- fig5
                #home-mortgage-arrears-chart.mb-2.mt-5
                .something
                  p  With respect to buy-to-let mortgages, 21.2% (31,227) were in arrears of more than 90 days, with 27.4% (40,426) in some level of arrears in Q3 2013.  
                //- fig6
                #btl-mortgage-arrears-chart.mb-2.mt-5
                .something
                  p  And as house prices dropped, the number of households in negative equity grew to include more than 50% of residential properties with a mortgage.
                  p  Similarly, rent arrears to local authorities, borough and town councils increased from €32.8m in January 2008 to €58.5m in December 2011 as tenants struggled to pay their bills.
                  
                  p  The huge house price rises in the Celtic Tiger years, followed by the financial pressures of the crash, had significant spillover effects with respect to social housing demands and homelessness.  In 1999 there were 39,176 households on the social housing waiting list, rising to 48,413 in 2002, 56,249 in 2008, and 98,318 in 2011.  The vast majority of people on the list are because they cannot afford private rental accommodation or to purchase.
                  //- fig7
                #social-housing-wait-chart.mb-2.mt-5 
                .something
                  p  The austerity programme implemented by two governments from 2008 onwards dramatically reduced state investment in social housing. The capital expenditure for social housing was reduced by 80% (from €1.3bn to €275m) between 2008 and 2013 and funding for the National Regeneration Programme reduced from €121 million in 2008 to €80 million in 2013 a 34% reduction.  
                  p  Between 2008 and 2013, 10,745 social housing units were built (nearly all – 8,267 – in 2008-09, much of it replacement stock in regeneration schemes), 3,293 were acquired through purchase and 8,707 long-term leases were acquired through RAS (see earlier graph).  While some stock was being built or acquired then, social housing needs were outstripping the state’s ability to supply suitable affordable accommodation.  
                  p  The shortfall in social housing is made-up through privately rented accommodation subsidized by rent supplement.  97,260 households were receiving rent supplement in late 2010, an increase of 63% on the previous three years, with spending rising from €70 million in the mid-1990s to €516.5 million in 2010.  
                  //- fig8
                #rent-suppliment-chart.mb-2.mt-5
              
                .something
                  p  Even with the state providing social housing or rent supplement, the financial and other pressures placed onto individuals and households during the crash saw a rise in homelessness: between 2008 and 2011 the number of homeless households increased by 68% to 2,348, with 3,808 people in accommodation for the homeless. 
                  p  Further, much social housing stock was acknowledged to be in poor condition.  Prior to the crash the decision was to taken for large-scale regeneration schemes in North Dublin (Ballymun) and other Dublin estates using public-private partnerships (PPPs). These PPP schemes collapsed with the crash as both private and public finances evaporated.  This left thousands of local authority tenants living in substandard conditions whilst awaiting re-location and many hundreds permanently relocated in preparation for regeneration.

                  p At the same, planned investment in Traveller accommodation nationally also stalled during this period. In 2013, there were 361 Traveller families living on unauthorised sites, and 5574 in various types of local authority housing.
