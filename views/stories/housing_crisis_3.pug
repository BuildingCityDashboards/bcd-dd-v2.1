          narrative: "<p>On December 24 2016, Dublin was declared a Rent Pressure Zone to restrict rampant price rises and require planning permission for short-term renting and for renting out multiple properties. From January 2016 through July 2018, the number of short-term rental properties on Airbnb increased by 4610 in Dublin City, 658 in Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown, 471 in FIngal, and 254 in South Dublin. Since then, however, the number of properties has decreased in each local authority except for Fingal.</p><p>Part of these regulations were meant to curb the use of full-time rental properties. If a property is available for more than 90 days, written planning permission from DHS is required. Over time, the average number of days in which Airbnb properties were available yearly has decreased. In January 2016, the average property in each local authority was available at least 200 days of the year. The average now is around 100 days.</p><p>Planning permission is also required for homeowners renting their non-primary place of residence. But this has not deterred owners of multiple properties from short-term renting. The average number of properties on Airbnb by the same host has risen. Dublin City hosts own an average of 4.3 properties, up from 2.2 in 2016.</p>"

          title: "Conclusion",
          narrative: "<p>In theory, a lot of the right criteria for creating supply exist. There is an excess of demand; there was 6,400 acres of zoned <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#serviced-land-chart'>serviced land</a> available in the four Dublin authorities for 132,000 units in 2014 and there are a lot of outstanding planning permissions still in effect and local authorities want to give permission for developments that meet development plan/zoning criteria.</p><p>Yet despite these conditions and the need to create supply it is clear that a hangover from <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>phase 2</a> of the crisis is blocking development. The state’s finances are limited, there are competing demands for scarce resources, and they are reluctant to significantly increase capital spending on housing and associated infrastructure. The banks are in a weak state and reluctant to lend for development. Builders and developers have limited initial capital to draw down additional finance. With respect to land, it may be the case that owners are reluctant to put into development because they bought it in the boom and cannot afford to develop at present housing prices. With respect to planning, it may be that developers are seeking permissions that contravene development plans or are trying to alter existing permissions. The property industry also argues that the system needs streamlining and simplifying.</p><p>The last twenty five years has seen a tumultuous set of changes with regards to Ireland’s housing sector and market. Throughout the entire period it has been transitioning through three phases of crisis. </p><p>In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1'> first phase</a>, there were crises of creating enough supply, very quickly rising prices to levels that were unaffordable for low and middle income households and reduced competitiveness, a significant increase in household debt and bank debt to precarious levels, over-zoning of land and dramatic price increases, the expansion of urban sprawl and long distance commuting.<p>In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>second phase</a>, the property bubble burst, the fallout was catastrophic for households, the state, and the wider economy. House prices plunged, estates remained unfinished, households were faced with extensive mortgage arrears and negative equity and/or poor build quality, the social housing waiting list extended, and more households became homeless.</p><p>In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-3'>third phase</a>, instead of the market returning and fixing the problems, there has been uneven mopping up of oversupply and little new supply of housing units. This has driven up purchase and rental prices in the cities and also created rising homelessness. This present phase is likely to last a number of years and is unlikely to address issues that have persisted since the 1990s, such as housing (to buy or rent) becoming increasingly unaffordable for ordinary citizens.</p>"
