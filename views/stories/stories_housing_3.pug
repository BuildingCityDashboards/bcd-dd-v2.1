          //- .position-anchor#phase3-1
        p The levelling off in the fall in <a href="housing-dublin-phase-1#property-price-growth-chart"> house prices</a>, followed by a gradual and then rapid increase of prices in Dublin (rising by 24.1% between October 2012 and 2013, before levelling off again in response to Central Bank interventions), is indicative of a new phase in the ongoing housing crisis.
       
        p This phase sees the continuation of the serious problems of phase 2, such as social housing need, private rent rises, mortgage arrears, negative equity, unfinished estates, but varying levels of change depending on the extent to which solutions are put in place and the wider economy starts to recover. For example, there was large-scale dezoning of serviced zoned land. By Q2 2018 <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#home-mortgage-arrears-chart'> mortgage accounts remaining in arrears </a> had dropped to less than 67,000 (9.2%), with 46,000 in arrears for more than 90 days (6.3%). With respect to <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#btl-mortgage-arrears-chart'> buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages</a>, 21,300 (18%) were in arrears, with 17,300 (14.7%) in arrears of more than 90 days.
       
        p The new or deepening crises in this period are a lack of supply in some areas and associated rising housing and rental prices, continued problems of social housing provision, and rising homelessness in response to a changing rental market.
        
        p Whilst there was oversupply in every single local authority nationwide for both houses and apartments (with the exception of South Dublin for houses) in 2011, the extent of this oversupply varied geographically. Much of rural Ireland had extensive levels of vacancy. In Dublin, the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#vacant-housing-chart'>overall vacancy rate</a> for the four local authorities was 8.4% (44,468 units). While the vacancy rate of houses was low, the vacancy rate for apartments was 16-19%.
       
        p Despite emigration during the crash, <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1#population-households-chart'>population and households have been growing</a> in Dublin through natural increase, labour migration, and household fragmentation. The levelling off of prices instilled confidence that the bottom of the market had been reached. In combination, the result was an increase in demand by investors trying to maximize return on investment and rental yields and households looking to enter the market. What oversupply there was in the capital was thus absorbed.
       
        p With respect to new supply, however, construction remained moribund. In 2016 only 4234 units were <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1#housing-completions-chart'> built in Dublin</a>. Assessments by both the Housing Agency and the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) suggest that c.8000 units are required per annum in the four Dublin local authorities. This is a very modest figure that is significantly below pre-crash construction rates and is unlikely to quell present demand.
       
        p The effect of very little new supply for either purchase or rent, but rising demand, led to the inflation of prices.
        //- fig1 - rent

        .position-anchor#phase3-2
        p One the effects of rent increases is that families who are income insecure – low wage, uncertain hours, flexible working, dependent on welfare – who reside in private rental accommodation cannot afford rent increases and rent supplement is not sufficient to cover the gap, with more than half of those receiving rent supplement having to top up their rent. Consequently, they are being priced out of their homes in favour of those who can afford the new rental price. These families find it difficult to find alternative private rented accommodation due to rent inflation across the rental sector and landlord preferences for tenants not reliant on rent supplement. With no social housing available, these families find themselves homeless.
         
        p Nationally, the Simon Community reported that in 2012, there was an increase of 24% in those using their services, to over 5,000 individuals. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) detail that a total of 5,480 adult individuals accessed homeless accommodation during 2015 in Dublin. As of April 2018, there were 1444 families homeless in Dublin living in emergency homeless accommodation.

        #homelessness-chart.plotly-chart-medium
         
        .position-anchor#phase3-3
        p Without a significant increase in the level of supply competition for property continues to intensify, with rising purchase and rental prices and increasing homelessness. 
         
        p In theory, a lot of the right criteria for creating supply exist. There is an excess of demand; there was 6,400 acres of zoned  <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#serviced-land-chart'>serviced land</a> available in the four Dublin authorities for 132,000 units in 2014 and there are a lot of outstanding planning permissions still in effect and local authorities want to give permission for developments that meet development plan/zoning criteria.
        p Yet despite these conditions and the need to create supply it is clear that a hangover from <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>phase 2</a> of the crisis is blocking development. The state’s finances are limited, there are competing demands for scarce resources, and they are reluctant to significantly increase capital spending on housing and associated infrastructure. The banks are in a weak state and reluctant to lend for development. Builders and developers have limited initial capital to draw down additional finance. With respect to land, it may be the case that owners are reluctant to put into development because they bought it in the boom and cannot afford to develop at present housing prices. With respect to planning, it may be that developers are seeking permissions that contravene development plans or are trying to alter existing permissions. The property industry also argues that the system needs streamlining and simplifying. 
      
        .position-anchor#phase3-conclusion
        h2 Conclusion
        p The last twenty five years has seen a tumultuous set of changes with regards to Ireland’s housing sector and market. Throughout the entire period it has been transitioning through three phases of crisis. 
        p In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1'> first phase</a>, there were crises of creating enough supply, very quickly rising prices to levels that were unaffordable for low and middle income households and reduced competitiveness, a significant increase in household debt and bank debt to precarious levels, over-zoning of land and dramatic price increases, the expansion of urban sprawl and long distance commuting. 
        p In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>second phase</a>, the property bubble burst, the fallout was catastrophic for households, the state, and the wider economy. House prices plunged, estates remained unfinished, households were faced with extensive mortgage arrears and negative equity and/or poor build quality, the social housing waiting list extended, and more households became homeless. 
        p In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-3'>third phase</a>, instead of the market returning and fixing the problems, there has been uneven mopping up of oversupply and little new supply of housing units. This has driven up purchase and rental prices in the cities and also created rising homelessness. This present phase is likely to last a number of years and is unlikely to address issues that have persisted since the 1990s, such as housing (to buy or rent) becoming increasingly unaffordable for ordinary citizens.
