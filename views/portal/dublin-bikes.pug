    p.lead What is it?   
    p Dublin Bikes API provides real time and static data. Static data provides stable 
      |information like station position, number of bike stands, payment terminal 
      |availability, etc.' Dynamic data provides station state, number of available bikes, 
      |number of free bike stands, etc.
           
    p.lead Where is it used?
    p As public bodies have progressed in areas like eGovernment and data analytics, the 
      |potential of data and, in particular, Open Data to help deliver economic, social and 
      |democratic benefits has become clearer. The data.gov.ie portal brings these datasets 
      |together in a single searchable website.
