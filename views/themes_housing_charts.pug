      p The <strong>Average Rents Dataset</strong> contains average rents being paid for particular 
        |time periods for five different categories of dwelling types in 446 locations 
        |throughout the country. The dataset is useful for checking the actual rent 
        |being paid for, say, a semi-detached house or a two-bed apartment in an area.
      p However, average rent changes if the mix of properties rented changes, therefore there 
        |is a need to mix–adjust to get a standardised rent. 
        |The <strong>Standardised Rent</strong> (see the 
        <a href="https://onestopshop.rtb.ie/research/ar" target="blank">Rent Index</a> 
        | for more details) is a mix-adjusted rent 
        |i.e. a measure of rents that takes account of the changing mix of properties rented 
        |in different time periods. 
        |The key point of the standardised index is that it takes into account the 
        |changing mix of properties rented in different time periods, whereas the average rents on their own do not.
