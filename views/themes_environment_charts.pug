      h2.mb-2 Waste Management Statistics
      p The Environmental Protection Agency keeps records on the waste and 
        |recycling produced by the four Local Authorities of Dublin and generates 
        |yearly reports for public dissemination. Dublin uses a “3 bin” system, 
        |which consists of non-recyclable waste (“black bin”), dry recyclables 
        |(“green bin”), and organic recyclables (“brown bin”). The following 
        |three historical plots – Waste Production Per Capita, Household Dry 
        |Recycling Rate, and Household Organic Recycling Rate – are derived 
        |from those reports available at the above link.

      p The EPA tracks the amount of waste collected from “black bins” locally

      p Each of the four local authorities’ waste production per capita are plotted 
        |over time, with per-person waste across Dublin decreasing since a 
        |relative high in 2008-2009.
