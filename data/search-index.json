This data story examines housing in the capital through the housing and planning data available for the city. There are two things to keep in mind in terms of understanding housing: First, it is a complex issue that involves a number of factors and outcomes including housing supply and demand (including homelessness), existing stock and type (social/private/rental, vacancy), house and rental prices, mortgage arrears and negative equity, access to land,  access to credit, planning permissions, homelessness, unfinished estates, land supply and price. Second, making sense of the present situation requires placing it in historical context. It is possible to make the case that housing in Ireland has been in crisis since the early 1990s and the start of the Celtic Tiger. Consequently, we have structured this data story into three parts corresponding to the three phases of the crisis: Phase 1: 1993-2006 (the Celtic Tiger years); Phase 2: 2007-2012 (the crash); Phase 3: 2013-present (post-crash).",

All of the issues built up over the course of the Celtic Tiger years exploded into a new set of crises, as the property bubble burst and the Irish banking sector collapsed. This culminated in the Irish bank guarantee of September 2008, the creation of the state-owned National Assets Management Agency (NAMA) in September 2009 (which bought €74 billion of distressed property loans from the Irish banks), and the €85 billion IMF–EU-ECB bailout in November 2010. While the global financial crisis was the trigger for the Irish crisis, Irish banks were little exposed to US subprime loans; rather, they were massively exposed to property and development loans in a bubble market.<sup>1</sup> Moreover, it soon became clear that not only were prices over-inflated, but that there was a massive oversupply of housing stock and over-zoning of land. Between 2005 and 2007 there were 252,403 a(href='housing-dublin-phase-1#housing-completions-chart') housing units completed in Ireland (connected to the electricity grid), with another 78,144 added in 2008 and 2009 as legacy construction slowed. This is despite the fact that the 2002 census had reported 143,418 vacant units and that, by the following census of 2006, that figure had grown to 266,322 vacant units. //- p.small.text-center Figure 2: Vacant housing 1991-2016.b Put simply, housing units had been built in excess of demand across the entire country, with a vacancy rate for the state (excluding holiday homes) above 15%. Allowing that one would always expect some units to be vacant in any housing market (typically about 6%) then oversupply was approximately 110,000 units.",

Building control and standards were deregulated in Ireland in 1990, with local authority planning enforcement only undertaking inspections on 10-15% of sites, and not at all stages of development. The highest profile case was Priory Hall in Dublin, where 187 apartments were found to breach fire hazard regulations- with residents forced to vacate their homes for two years whilst continuing to pay mortgages- but there have been numerous other similar examples. Furthermore, there are estimated to be in excess of 20,000 homes whose foundation hardcore and building blocks are contaminated with pyrite; the DECLG presently only recognizes 74 estates containing 12,250 units however, predominately located in Dublin City, Fingal, Meath, Kildare, and Offaly. In addition to the oversupply of dwellings, there was also an oversupply of zoned land and commercial premises.

	"content": "The levelling off in the fall in <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1#property-price-growth-chart'> house prices</a>, followed by a gradual and then rapid increase of prices in Dublin (rising by 24.1% between October 2012 and 2013, before levelling off again in response to Central Bank interventions), is indicative of a new phase in the ongoing housing crisis. This phase sees the continuation of the serious problems of phase 2, such as social housing need, private rent rises, mortgage arrears, negative equity, unfinished estates, but varying levels of change depending on the extent to which solutions are put in place and the wider economy starts to recover. For example, there was large-scale dezoning of serviced zoned land. By Q2 2018 <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#home-mortgage-arrears-chart'> mortgage accounts remaining in arrears </a> had dropped to less than 67,000 (9.2%), with 46,000 in arrears for more than 90 days (6.3%). With respect to <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#btl-mortgage-arrears-chart'> buy-to-let (BTL) mortgages</a>, 21,300 (18%) were in arrears, with 17,300 (14.7%) in arrears of more than 90 days. The new or deepening crises in this period are a lack of supply in some areas and associated rising housing and rental prices, continued problems of social housing provision, and rising homelessness in response to a changing rental market. Whilst there was oversupply in every single local authority nationwide for both houses and apartments (with the exception of South Dublin for houses) in 2011, the extent of this oversupply varied geographically. Much of rural Ireland had extensive levels of vacancy. In Dublin, the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2#vacant-housing-chart'>overall vacancy rate</a> for the four local authorities was 8.4% (44,468 units). While the vacancy rate of houses was low, the vacancy rate for apartments was 16-19%. Despite emigration during the crash, <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1#population-households-chart'>population and households have been growing</a> in Dublin through natural increase, labour migration, and household fragmentation. The levelling off of prices instilled confidence that the bottom of the market had been reached. In combination, the result was an increase in demand by investors trying to maximize return on investment and rental yields and households looking to enter the market. What oversupply there was in the capital was thus absorbed. With respect to new supply, however, construction remained moribund. In 2016 only 4234 units were <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1#housing-completions-chart'> built in Dublin</a>. Assessments by both the Housing Agency and the Economic Social Research Institute (ESRI) suggest that c.8000 units are required per annum in the four Dublin local authorities. This is a very modest figure that is significantly below pre-crash construction rates and is unlikely to quell present demand. The effect of very little new supply for either purchase or rent, but rising demand, led to the inflation of prices.",

Consequently, they are being priced out of their homes in favour of those who can afford the new rental price. These families find it difficult to find alternative private rented accommodation due to rent inflation across the rental sector and landlord preferences for tenants not reliant on rent supplement. With no social housing available, these families find themselves homeless. Nationally, the Simon Community reported that in 2012, there was an increase of 24% in those using their services, to over 5,000 individuals. The Dublin Region Homeless Executive (DRHE) detail that a total of 5,480 adult individuals accessed homeless accommodation during 2015 in Dublin.

Yet despite these conditions and the need to create supply it is clear that a hangover from <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>phase 2</a> of the crisis is blocking development. The state’s finances are limited, there are competing demands for scarce resources, and they are reluctant to significantly increase capital spending on housing and associated infrastructure. The banks are in a weak state and reluctant to lend for development. Builders and developers have limited initial capital to draw down additional finance. With respect to land, it may be the case that owners are reluctant to put into development because they bought it in the boom and cannot afford to develop at present housing prices. With respect to planning, it may be that developers are seeking permissions that contravene development plans or are trying to alter existing permissions.

In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-1'> first phase</a>, there were crises of creating enough supply, very quickly rising prices to levels that were unaffordable for low and middle income households and reduced competitiveness, a significant increase in household debt and bank debt to precarious levels, over-zoning of land and dramatic price increases, the expansion of urban sprawl and long distance commuting. In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-2'>second phase</a>, the property bubble burst, the fallout was catastrophic for households, the state, and the wider economy. House prices plunged, estates remained unfinished, households were faced with extensive mortgage arrears and negative equity and/or poor build quality, the social housing waiting list extended, and more households became homeless. In the <a href='housing-dublin-phase-3'>third phase</a>, instead of the market returning and fixing the problems, there has been uneven mopping up of oversupply and little new supply of housing units. This has driven up purchase and rental prices in the cities and also created rising homelessness.
