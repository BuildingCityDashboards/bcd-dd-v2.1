The proposed amendments to the previously permitted development provides for the omission of the permitted ground floor Mezzanine Level (705 sq.m (GFA)); the incorporation of the previously permitted penthouse level into the main building envelope by increasing the previously permitted 5-storey shoulder height of the building from 27.09 AOD to provide a uniform 6-storey building height of 28.68m AOD resulting in an increased 5th floor level floorplate from 915sq.m to 1,420 sq.m (GFA); together with external alterations to provide a completely revised design/facade treatment to the permitted northern, southern, eastern and western elevations. No alterations are proposed to the permitted building footprint or the permitted uses. The overall permitted building height is reduced from 31.05m AOD (top of permitted penthouse level) to a uniform 28.68m AOD height due to the omission of the previously permitted Mezzanine Level and the associated rationalisation of finished floor levels. Due to the omission of the ground floor Mezzanine Level and the increased 5th floor level floorplate, the overall gross floorspace of the permitted building is marginally reduced from 11,560 sq.m to 11,360 sq.m (including basement levels). Reduction of car parking spaces at Basement Level -1 from 23 spaces to 20 spaces together with a reduction of bicycle storage at Basement Level -2 from 115 spaces to 75 spaces.",

The development will consist of : Internal works and reconfiguration of the existing Arnott's Department store (41,904 sq.m gross floor area) and creation of a new independent retail unit (totalling 3,783 sq.m gross floor area over four levels - basement, ground, first and second floor levels) with independent access to street level from an existing entrance at 7-9 Henry Street. The works to create the new retail unit involve construction of internal partition walls at basement, ground first and second floors only and the lowering of floor level at ground and basement levels (by 460mm and 700mm respectively) to facilitate improved pedestrian access from the new retail unit to adjoining street level. The accommodation at third and fourth floor levels above the new retail unit will remain as part of the ancillary accommodation associated with the Arnott's store. A new internal emergency stair core is proposed from basement to second floor level to serve the Arnott's store with a new emergency door to Henry Street ground floor elevation. The Arnott's Department Store will be reduced in size from 41,904 sq.m to 38,121 sq.m gross floor area as a result of the creation of the new unit and the works proposed. Deliveries to the new retail unit will be via the existing Proby's Lane service entrance. New screens are proposed to the existing plant areas at roof level over 7-9 Henry Street. Permissions sought for all associated internal & external site and development works. 7-15 Henry Street is included on the Record of Protected Structures (REF 3666 - Arnott's: Upper floor facade, First-floor cornice detail and shop front (excluding canopy and vertical sign ; including tower and clock feature).",

Permission is sought to use both buildings as a single 58 bedroom hotel with ancillary hotel services. The development seeks to retain the original elements of No. 82 which are confined to external walls, entrance door and windows of No. 82 and all parts of No. 81.\r\nIt is proposed to remove mid-20th century elements comprising ground floor concrete slab; upper floor slabs and supporting columns; concrete ring beam and lintels; steel roof structures and asbestos roofing in No. 82, the warehouse building. An additional two floors with a planted flat roof will be provided above the existing eaves level of No. 82, resulting in a five storey building. The exterior upper floors will be clad using a series of corten steel fins arranged vertically either side of the window openings. It is also proposed to provide a two-storey basement to a reduced footprint of the main structure at No. 82. The asbestos/ metal clad asymmetrical roof with roof lights to the single storey annex to the west of No. 82 will be open with a glass canopy to the west. \r\nNo. 81 will be restored to its previous use at Ground Level as a bar with 7 boutique hotel bedrooms located at both Levels 1 and 2. The non-original single-storey structure to the rear is to be removed. A single-storey annex to the west of No. 81 will be provided, accommodating the entrance to the proposed bar, seating area and sanitary facilities. A garden will be reinstated to the rear. A new single access point at ground floor level will link the two buildings internally.\r\nConservation works in No. 82 will include removal of mid 20th Century elements, the repair and reinstatement of historic features both internal and external. A new structure will be inserted independent of historic walls to align with existing fenestration. Conservation work in No. 81 will include the repair and reinstatement of the former premises to its previous condition.\r\nThe main hotel entrance will be from North Wall Quay. The ground floor and two basement floors at No. 82 will contain the hotel communal facilities, including reception, café, bar and meeting and conference facilities. A restaurant and bar will occupy the top floor. The three intermediary floors will accommodate 51 bedrooms with 7 further bedrooms in No. 81.

PL29S.238212) as subsequently amended by planning permission DCC Ref. 2286/12 (ABP Ref. PL240620). \r\nAmendments to Block 1 include an amended footprint, form and layout of the block together with the conversion and change of use of 22 no. residential units (comprising 18 x 2 bed units and 4 x 3 bed units) at ground to 5th floor level in the northern part of Block 1 to office use (2,657.8 sq.m). Change of use and infill of part of previously permitted courtyard semi-private open space (440 sq.m) to retail use and amalgamation of previously permitted retail units to provide a single convenience retail outlet of 937 sq.m. Omission of management office and ESB sub-station and realignment of vehicular access ramp to basement level. Reconfiguration of previously permitted office lobby and retail unit together with a change of use from part office and retail use to café/ restaurant use (258 sq.m) reconfiguration of previously permitted residential units at first floor level to provide access to a proposed roof garden at first floor level. External alterations include the re-configuration of balconies / roof terraces to the block at all levels and the provision of a bridgelink at third floor level connecting Block 1 and Block 2. Amendments to floor to ceiling heights of Block 1 resulting in an overall increase in the permitted building height from 22.65 m to 24.05m, as measured from ground level to parapet level at the north-eastern corner of the block. Amendments to Block 2 include an amended footprint, form, layout (including omission of previously approved central courtyard landscaped garden) and change of uses at ground floor level to include: the omission of Cinema use at ground floor level (94 sq.m), change of Retail floorspace from 1,109 sq.m to 400 sq.m to be contained in two separate units instead of the previously permitted 3 units; change of use of previously permitted retail floorspace to provide a Restaurant unit with a floorspace of 385 sq.m and increasing the previously approved office floorspace from 995 sq.m to 1,630 sq.m. Alterations to previously approved cinema, retail and circulation cores to provide a new vehicular access and egress ramp to the reconfigured basement level car park below (approximately mid-way along the south-eastern ground floor elevation of Block 2) resulting in the omission of 2 previously permitted on-street car parking spaces along the permitted new east-west street together with associated external alterations. Internal and external alterations to the layout of Block 2 at first to fifth floor level to include the omission of a reconfiguration of the previously dispersed stair cores into a centrally positioned main stair and lift cores and omission of previously approved balconies/ terraces to provide an increased quantum of office floorspace from 1,943 sq.m to 2,748 sq.m at first floor level; from 2,073.5 sq.m to 2,821 sq.m at second to fourth floor levels and from 2,043 sq.m to 2,775 sq.m at fifth floor level. Amendments to floor to ceiling heights resulting in an overall increase of the permitted building height from 22.72 m to 24.05 m, as measured from ground level to parapet level. Basement level below Blocks 1 and 2 to include change of use and conversion of previously approved basement level car parking to office (2,318 sq.m); change of use and conversion of previously approved Cinema (Block 2) to car parking and ancillary plant provision; general reconfiguration of basement level car parking layout; Omission of previously approved sub-basement level Cinema (Block 2) and provision of new sub-basement level car park below Block 1 to provide ancillary car parking and plant. The proposed amendments result in an increase in the level of basement car parking from 381 no. spaces to 401 no. spaces. Amendments to Block 4 include a reduction in one of the previously permitted restaurant unit(s)/ floorspace from a previously permitted 117 sq.m to 108; an increase in residential units from a previously permitted 73 no. units (comprising 18 x 1 bed; 27 x 2 bed and 28 x 3 bed units) to 86 no. units (comprising 9 x 1 bed; 53 x 2 bed and 24 x 3 bed units), resulting in an increase of 13 no. residential units. The above changes are facilitated through an increased footprint and form of the block at the northern end together with associated internal alterations to the layout and configuration of the block and the extension of previously permitted 5th floor and the provision of a new part-6th floor extension. External alterations include the reconfiguration of balconies/ roof terraces to the block at all levels. The proposed extensions will result in a revised height and mass of Block 4 from a part 1-, part 4-, part 5- and part 6-storey height (21.8 m in height to parapet, above ground level) to a part 1-, part 5-, part 6- and part 7-storey building height (24.075 m in height to parapet, above ground level). Amendments to Block 5 include a reduction in floorspace of the previously permitted café/ restaurant floorspace from a previously permitted 116.5 sq.m to 98.4 sq.m; an increase in the number of residential units from a previously permitted 42 no. units (comprising 4 x 1 bed; 30 x 2 bed and 8 x 3 bed units) to 57 no. units (comprising 6 x 1 bed; 46 x 2 bed and 5 x 3 bed units), resulting in an increase of 15 no. residential units.\r\nThe above changes are facilitated through proposed extensions at 4th and 5th floor levels together with a revised footprint and form of the block and associated internal alterations to the layout and configuration of the block. External alterations include the reconfiguration of balconies/ roof terraces to the block at all levels. The proposed extensions will result in a revised height and mass of Block 5 from a previously approved part 4- and part 5-storey height (17.78 m in height to parapet, above ground level) to a part 5- and part 6-storey building height (21.05 m in height to parapet, above ground level).\r\nIn summary, the proposed amendments to Block 1, 2, 4 and 5 will result in a revised mix of uses through the entire omission of the previously approved cinema; a reduction (-88 sq.m) in retail floorspace from 1,425 sq.m to 1,337 sq.m; an increase (45 sq.m) in Café floorspace from 213 sq.m to a proposed 258 sq.m; a reduction (-65.1 sq.m) in restaurant floorspace from 935.7 sq.m to 870.6 sq.m and an increase of 7,395 sq.m in office floorspace from 16,949 sq.m to 24,344 sq.m (GFA), together with an increase (6 no. residential) in the number of residential units from a permitted 178 units to 184 units.",
