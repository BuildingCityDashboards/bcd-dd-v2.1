The development also provided for 8 car parking spaces to the rear and 28 bicycle parking spaces in the basement. The proposed amendments to the permitted development consist of: 1. Redesigned external elevations to upper floors and to include more appropriate retail frontage at ground floor level; 2. Moving of bicycle parking from basement to the rear yard accessed from Harrington Court and to provide a revised layout to the previously approved 8 no. car parking spaces. 3. A rationalisation of internal spaces including cores & circulation space. As a result of the proposed amendments, the over all floor area is to increase from 3,739 sq.m as approved under the previous Permission (Reg. Ref. 3015/15) to 3,815 sq.m (an increase of 76 sq.m).",

The proposed amendments to Basement Level -1 include a reconfiguration of the basement layout and reduction in floor area of approximately 343 sq.m. Provision of a lightwell measuring approximately 13.7m wide by 2.3m deep along the northern basement wall serving the previously permitted office floorspace at basement -1 level together with associated external alterations comprising glazing provision and door opening into landscaped lightwell. Reconfigured layout of previously permitted office floorspace, including a reduction in the previously approved quantum of office floorspace at basement level -1 level from 2,318 sq.m to 2,105 sq.m - a reduction of 213 sq.m of office floorspace in total. Provision of a new ancillary gym measuring approximately 145 sq.m. General reconfiguration of basement layout at level - 1 to provide revised circulation cores; changing facilities; bicycle storage provision (number of cycle storage spaces remain un-altered at 518 no. spaces); refuse storage areas; residential storage facilities; plant rooms; store rooms; switch rooms and car parking layout (reduce number of car parking spaces from 303 to 297).

The development relates to proposed modifications to part of the wider redevelopment of the site at No’s 13-30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Dublin 2 comprising most of a city block bounded by Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Mount Street Upper, James’s Street East and Baggot Street Lower permitted under An Bord Pleanála Reference PL29S.244492 (Dublin City Council Reference 3052/14) currently under construction.  \r\n\r\nA change of use is proposed to the basement level of No. 55, comprising the decommissioning of the existing ESB substation and the redevelopment of this space (c.64 sq m) for office use to integrate with existing permitted office use.  Associated internal changes include provision of internal partitions; external works include provision of a new window to the front (north-east) elevation and the removal of the existing external stairs to Mount Street Upper.  Other minor modifications associated with the change of use are the provision of internal links to No. 56 at basement level.  Additional minor works (internal reconfiguration) are proposed to the permitted office space at basement level, along with modifications to the 2 no. rooflights at Nos. 56 and 57.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed works to Nos. 58-61 (inclusive – accommodating 8 no. residential units) comprise modest enlargement of the rear returns to provide additional internal area (total combined additional internal floor area c.18 sq m); and the provision of 8 no. Juliet Balconies to the living areas at ground and first floor levels (rear) including alterations to fenestration and design modifications to permitted balconies at 2nd floor level.  A new enclosing boundary wall and single storey store is provided at lower ground level to the rear of No.61.\r\n\r\nThe proposed works at Nos. 30 and 62 include the omission of the permitted annex with roof terrace, and demolition of existing lift shaft structure to the rear; reconfiguration of the internal layouts of the apartment units at ground, 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor and the provision of balconies at ground, 1st and 2nd floors with alterations to fenestration onto same; external part-covered rear access; minor modifications at roof level (omission of dormer; provision of additional 2 no. roof lights); and alterations to permitted fenestration to rear elevation of No. 30.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to improve the fire safety standard of the building at No.29 (the Museum of Georgian Living) incorporating improvement of the fire resistance of the building fabric; improvements to the fire protection of escape routes including upgrading of doors, lighting, services installation, signage, fire detection and alarm systems, and alterations to the rear fenestration.  These fire safety improvements will remove the need for a connection between No. 29 and No.30.  The proposed development, however, provides for an alternative layout, which includes a glazed annex connection between No.29 and No.30 at 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor levels.  \r\n\r\nThe development will also include new letterboxes, keypads and amendments to the existing gates and stairs at street level at House Nos. 57 and 61; minor associated amendments to hard and soft landscaping and all other associated site development works above and below ground including alteration work to the external cellars, and integration of ESB metres under the pavement along Mount Street Upper.",

Retention permission is also sought for the new two storey gable wall (including window) to modified No. 50. The widened laneway involving the partial demolition, extension and reconfiguration of 50 Dollymount Avenue was previously permitted under Reg. Ref. 4203/06x1. This permission withered before the development at No. 50 Dollymount Avenue could be completed. The widened laneway has subsequently also been permitted under reg. Ref. 3521/12, and those works are complete and the laneway is now operational. Permission is further sought for the completion, alteration and extension to this existing house so as now to provide a 2-storey 2-bed end of terrace house, to include a new double height bay window feature to the front elevation, reconfiguration of fenestration to reflect proportions of the altered house, adjustments to the roof profile, construction of a new single storey rear extension with velux windows in the roof (c.29.5m), and provision of a new side garden/boundary wall of approx. 2.3m in height, rising to approx. 3.575m in height nearest the house.

An amount of lath and plaster has been removed and is lost. \r\n3) Damp-proofing works have been carried out to the basement area.\r\n4) Dry rot at basement and ground floor levels has been treated.\r\n5) There was little extant historic joinery in the house when purchased. Doors were modern copies of period doors and have been retained.\r\n6) The stair, handrail and balusters are mainly intact. Spindles where missing have been copied and inserted. Repairs have been made to the historic mahogany handrail.\r\n7)  There were several complete or partial chimney pieces in place when purchased. These have been cleaned and retained. \r\n8) The connecting double doors and door case between the Ground Floor Level Saloon Rooms had been historically removed and the opening had been blocked up with a single modern door installed in the former opening. This modern door has been removed and the arrangement has been restored to separate rooms.\r\n9) An historic two storey return room is now a Kitchen/Dining area.\r\n10) The front elevation brickwork has been cleaned.\r\n11) 4 no. wrought iron balconettes that were deemed to be irrepairable have been removed from the front facade and 4 no. painted galvanized steel replacements are now in place.\r\n12) The brickwork rear facade and Rear Return have been re-pointed in flush lime mortar finish.\r\n13) At 4th floor level 2 no. Ablutions Areas are in place.\r\n14) Existing defective and leaking roofing materials including fibre cement slates have been removed, the remaining existing blue bangor slates have been fixed to the front slope of the roof and the other slopes were fitted with new fibre cement slates.\r\n15) The defective and dangerous existing services have been removed. The house has been re-wired, re-plumbed, and a new heating system has been installed. This work has involved extensive chasing of original brick walls with the resultant loss of material including historic lime plaster.\r\n16) A new galvanised steel stairway from the street down the front open Basement Area has been installed to replace the stairway that had been removed prior to the purchase of the house.\r\n17) A number of extant non-original partitions were removed and the areas made good.\r\n18) The tarmacadamed car park in the rear garden has been retained.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "The proposed development site extends to 5,857 square metres in area and will have a gross floor area of 37,722 square metres, including basement areas of 14,970 square metres. The application site is bounded by Nassau Street to the north and the rear of buildings fronting Nassau Street, Setanta Place to the south (including existing basement levels beneath Setanta Place street level), to the east by Kildare Street and the rear of the buildings fronting Kildare Street, and to the west by the rear of buildings fronting Frederick Street South. The planning applications relates to development which adjoins the rear of protected structures fronting 22 - 30 Frederick Street South, the rear of No. 5 and 16 - 19 Nassau Street and the rear of 45- 46 Kildare Street.\r\n\r\nThe number of storeys on the existing buildings on the site varies up to a maximum of 8 storeys with roof-top plant and equipment over 2 basement levels. The development will consist of the demolition, excavation and clearance of all existing buildings and structures on the site including basements other than the existing Kilkenny Design Store and annex 1,455 square metres and associated basement areas of 1,432 square metres (notated on the planning application drawings as 'SG1' and 'SG2' at B-1) which do not form part of the demolition/construction proposals. The western boundary walls to the rear of the protected structures fronting Frederick Street South and rear of 5 and 16-19 Nassau Street will be demolished and new boundary walls constructed. In addition to the demolition of the buildings, the development also provides for the demolition of the two existing basements (excluding the basement levels beneath Setanta Place which are retained and remodelled internally), and car park ramps from Setanta Place. Following the above demolitions, excavations and site clearance the development provides for the construction a new office building extending to 8 storeys in height including setbacks at 6th, 7th and 8th storey over 4 basement levels (the two basement levels beneath Setanta Place which are retained and remodelled and are notated on the planning application drawings as 'SG1' and 'SG2' at basement level B-1) and new car park access/egress ramps off Setanta Place. The existing vehicular connection beneath Setanta Place between the application site and public car parking spaces in the building known as 10-11 Molesworth Street will be reinstated.\r\n\r\nThe proposed basement levels will contain 211 car parking spaces (of which 141 will be for public use with the balance i.e. 70 for private use). The number of onsite car parking spaces on the overall site will be reduced from the existing 319 spaces to 211 spaces. The basement areas will also contain300 bicycle parking spaces along with associated drying areas, bicycle repair facilities, showers and locker/changing/storage areas, accessed via a dedicated cycle access/egress ramp off Setanta Place, circulation, waste receptacle areas, plant and equipment and tenant facilities. Service and deliveries will be from Nassau Street and Setanta Place and via basement areas.\r\n\r\nA swimming pool and gymnasium are proposed at ground and B-1 levels. The development incorporates sustainable development measures including roof mounted photovoltaic cells (500sq.m), green roof areas, rain water harvesting, air-sourced heat-pumps and attenuation tank. The pedestrian link between Nassau Street and Setanta Place will be repositioned and upgraded. It is also proposed to relocate the existing mosaic mural known as the \"Tain Wall\" for the western boundary wall forward towards Nassau Street.\r\n\r\nThe proposal includes roof terraces at 5th floor level to the northern, eastern and western elevations facing towards Nassau Street, South Frederick Street and Kildare Street respectively. The main entrance to the proposed development will be off Nassau Street, with secondary entrances off the pedestrian link and Setanta Place. A pedestrian entrance is also provided off Kildare Street. The proposed development provides for 1 no. double ESB substation fronting Setanta Place along with all associated site development works including landscaping and boundary treatments and air intake and out-let fans and ducts/vents including screened roof top mounted plant and equipment including zone for communications equipment (satellite dishes/aerials) at seventh and eight storeys.\r\n",
