        "DevelopmentDescription" : "RETENTION: Permission and retention permission for development at this site: Beneavin Lodge, Beneavin Road, Glasnevin, Dublin 11. The proposal consists of several related elements, namely: Alterations to planning approval ref 2060/12 by the provision of new basement car parking and cycle stands beneath the approved four storey nursing care accommodation wing to the south of the site adjacent to Beneavin College playing fields, and would include minor alterations to the eastern end of this four storey block at ground floor level to provide reception with lift and stairs to the basement below and the floors above. At the upper floors above reception, additional activity room accommodation would be provided. A further lift would be provided to create access to the existing reception within Beneavin Lodge. Access to the basement would be by way of a ramp parallel to the playing field boundary from the newly created access road off Beneavin Road, approved under planning ref. 3602/14. The basement parking would allow the removal of surface parking provision which would be converted to landscaped amenity space. The proposal also covers the demolition of the single storey element of the existing entrance foyer and adjacent day room, to create an open landscaped secure courtyard which is a feature of existing care provision across the campus. Additionally the proposal would seek to extend the December 2014 approved scheme (ref. 3602/14) which provided for residential nursing care accommodation for those suffering from dementia, by the addition of new end of life palliative care suites with new ground floor reception and GP office, sluice and activity rooms at upper floors over, and a basement with plant rooms, storage, lift and stairs providing access to and from the basement parking noted previously. The proposal would also include for the retention of a new pedestrian entrance off Beneavin Road to Beneavin Lodge reception and cover alterations to storm and foul drainage and high quality hard and soft landscaping at surface level. Parking would be commensurate with current DCC guidelines, and disability access would be provided for throughout the scheme.\r\n",

This application relates to proposed development within the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone (within Block 2A & 2C of Planning Scheme). The development, comprising 1,900sq.m (0.19 hectares) will consist of a temporary entrance and access road from Park Lane to Iarnród Eireann's North Wall Yard, via an underpass beneath Sheriff Street Upper. The development will include a new gated entrance (28m frontage opening) to be constructed north of Mayor Street on the eastern side of Park Lane. The private access road is generally 8m in width and 150m in total length, part of which is an existing private road previously constructed by Iarnród Eireann. Lighting, fencing, CCTV and vehicle management controls will be implemented at the entrance and along the route. The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. In order to facilitate construction of the new entrance and access road, and for a short period of 1-2months, construction traffic will access the site from an existing entrance and access road to the site from New Wapping Street. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900), Monday to Friday) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts, etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility on a temporary basis until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved. This application is also subject to a concurrent and inter-related planning application for a coach parking facility to the north of Sheriff Street Upper, which is on lands outside the Grand Canal and North Lotts Strategic Development Zone. \r\n",

(The site for this amendment application forms part of a larger site for planning purposes of 0.1326 ha that includes The Chancery, 3-10 Chancery Lane, Dublin 8, D08 E4PK, the latter now in separate ownership). The proposed development will consist of the change of use of the permitted building to be constructed on the Napper Tandy site (and revision as appropriate to the conditions attaching to that permission) to provide 51 No. studios ranging in size from 18 sq m to 29.5 sq m. (Allowance is also made for the inter-connection of certain studios at first, second, third and fourth floor levels to have the option in lettings to facilitate larger units.) An ancillary cafe (30 sq m) is provided on an elevated level at reception/ground floor level. The proposal will also consist of: the reduction in size of the permitted basement from 146 sq m to 97 sq m (to accommodate back-of-house facilities and bicycle storage for ten bicycles); associated alterations to permitted floor plans (ground floor decreased by 5 sq m; first to fourth floors increased by 2 sq m each; fifth floor increased by 4 sq m; and sixth and seventh floor levels increased by 5 sq m each); the omission of the basement level link between the proposed development and of The Chancery Building (including the removal of the permitted 30 No. bicycle spaces in the latter); revisions to the ground level entrance doors to Chancery Lane/Bride Street and associated glazing (the latter including views through to the basement below); and the provision of associated signage and canopies over the footpaths to the permitted Bride Street and Chancery Lane elevations. These alterations are proposed together with previously permitted ancillary facilities including plant/solar panels and landscaped open space at roof level and the provision of photovoltaic panels on the southern elevation, and all other ancillary works above and below ground. The total gross floor area of the permitted building on the Napper Tandy site is decreased from 1,717 sq m to 1,685 sq m.",

The proposed development will be concentrated on the southern portion of the overall site (which currently has permission for a permitted office development under Reg.Ref. 2768/09, as extended under Reg.Ref. 2768/09/x1). The permitted hotel development on the northern portion of the site was recently modified under Reg.Ref. 3755/15 and included a new landscaping scheme for the street to the south side. There are no changes proposed to the permitted hotel building under the current application. Permission is sought to construct a student accommodation facility (including ancillary services and 2 no. business incubation hubs) and convert an existing vacant stone structure into a two storey office (total gfa c.9,634 sq.m). The student accommodation building will contain 303 bedspaces with 49 no. clusters, together with ancillary student accommodation facilities including communal areas, laundry and waste facilities and single storey standalone gym. The 2 no.business incubation hubs are integrated into the student facility. The proposed development is arranged in a single 'U' shaped block configuration enclosing a central landscaped courtyard along with a paved external terrace in the south west corner and a further linear garden to the south. The building ranges in height from 7 no. storeys down to 4 no. storeys in addition to a single storey free standing gym pavilion on the western side of the Courtyard Garden. Access to the Courtyard is provided through two gated entrance undercrofts from the permitted new street to the north and from Blackpitts respectively. The landscaping of the permitted new street to the north will be modified to accommodate fire tender access and additional cycle spaces. The proposed development also includes secure bicycle parking for 150 bikes; plant at roof level, an ESB substation at street level on Blackpitts; a small basement for plant services at the south eastern corner of the building along with all associated site infrastructure works.",
