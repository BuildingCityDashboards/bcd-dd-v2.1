The proposed development will consist of alterations to the existing two storey, flat-roofed, 6m (metre) high (approximate, to parapet level), 146 square metre (sq.m) (approximate gross floor space) mews house (Dublin City Council Registry Reference 0816/97) comprising: (a) the addition of a new barrel-vaulted zinc clad roof, with timber and glass clad gable ends and 6 zinc clad rounded dormer windows (3 on each side of the barrel-vaulted roof), to provide habitable floor area within the new attic space/second floor level. The new barrel-vaulted roof will have a roof ridge height of approximately 8.9m above ground level. (b) extending the building forward by 0.4m to the street-line on Percy Lane (within the front building line of the original mews structure) to include a shallow first floor balcony at the front of the mews house facing to the south-east which will be obscured by a full height glass screen at first floor level, to prevent overlooking onto the lane, behind which the existing first floor windows will be replaced with full height glazed doors. (c) construction of a new three storey extension (two storey plus the new barrel-vaulted attic/second floor level) to the rear of the mews house, with sliding glazed doors opening into the rear garden at ground level and a glass brise soleil on the rear facade at first floor level. (d) provision of a roof terrace at the rear of the mews house at second floor level facing to the north-east and north-west to be surrounded by a raised planted area and a 1.5m high obscured glazing privacy screen (to prevent overlooking). (e) replacement of the two existing garage spaces and central entrance hall accessing Percy Lane with a single larger garage space and relocated larger entrance hall, with the ground floor front facade to be clad in timber and glass, including a 3.3m wide timber 'up and over' inwards opening garage door, and various other internal changes including the provision of a wheelchair accessible lift to all floors. (f) construction of a new 1.8m high (approximate) rear boundary wall, and all associated site works; all within the curtilage of a protected structure. The gross floor space of the extended mews house will now be 241sq.m. (approximate gross floor space).\r\n",

The removal of a section of the boundary wall north of the Wylie gate was permitted under Dublin City Council planning reg. ref. 2617/03 (An Bord Pleanala ref. 29S.205688). The site boundary wall, railings, gates and gate piers of the RDS are protected structures; G) Revised Landscaping:- to include revised plaza area ( and associated changes to levels) replacement trees along western facade of newly configured office block & new pocket layout & yard wall to existing support area/ yard; H) Revisions to permitted attenuation including foul and surface water arrangements including all associated site development and landscaping works. The proposed amendments would result in a decrease in overall Gross Floor Area (above ground) of approx. 23sq.m (from 11,328 sq.m to 11,305sq.m) comprising a reduction in floor space per floor of: 332sq.m at ground floor; 109sq.m at first, second and third floors and an increase in floorspace per floor of: 143sq.m at fourth floor level, 460sq.m at fifth floor level and 33sq.m at plant (sixth floor) level.

Construction traffic will access the facility from New Wapping Street via an existing private internal access road passing beneath Sheriff Street. During the operational phase, coaches will access the facility from a new entrance on Park Lane connecting to the existing internal access road. The development will include repairs and minor expansion to the surface of the concrete hardstand and internal access road (1.7 hectares), together with incorporation of single storey portacabin building for security and welfare facility (72m2), lighting, CCTV, vehicle management controls and signage, bus bay line markings, installation of drainage control infrastructure and alterations to existing boundary hoarding at Park Lane entrance (to facilitate vehicle access and egress). The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts, etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility on a temporary basis until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved.\r\n",

Construction traffic will access the facility from New Wapping Street via an existing private internal access road passing beneath Sheriff Street. During the operational phase, coaches will access the facility from a new entrance on Park Lane connecting to the existing internal access road. The development will include repairs and minor expansion to the surface of the concrete hard-stand and internal access road (1.7 hectares), together with incorporation of single storey portacabin building for security and welfare facility (72 sq.m), lighting, CCTV, vehicle management controls and signage, bus bay line markings, installation of drainage control infrastructure and alterations to existing boundary hoarding at Park Lane entrance (to facilitate vehicle access and egress). The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility on a temporary basis until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved.\r\n",

At the upper floors above reception, additional activity room accommodation would be provided. A further lift would be provided to create access to the existing reception within Beneavin Lodge. Access to the basement would be by way of a ramp parallel to the playing field boundary from the newly created access road off Beneavin Road, approved under planning ref. 3602/14. The basement parking would allow the removal of surface parking provision which would be converted to landscaped amenity space. The proposal also covers the demolition of the single storey element of the existing entrance foyer and adjacent day room, to create an open landscaped secure courtyard which is a feature of existing care provision across the campus. Additionally the proposal would seek to extend the December 2014 approved scheme(ref. 3602/14) which provided for residential nursing care accommodation for those suffering from dementia, by the addition of new end of life palliative care suites with new ground floor reception and GP office, sluice and activity rooms at upper floors over, and a basement with plant rooms, storage, lift and stairs providing access to and from the basement parking noted previously. The proposal would also include for the provision of a new pedestrian entrance off Beneavin Road to Beneavin Lodge reception and cover alterations to storm and foul drainage and high quality hard and soft landscaping at surface level. Parking would be commensurate with current DCC guidelines, and disability access would be provided for through-out the scheme.\r\n",
