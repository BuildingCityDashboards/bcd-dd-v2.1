The new barrel-vaulted roof will have a roof ridge height of approximately 8.9m above ground level. (b) extending the building forward by 0.4m to the street-line on Percy Lane (within the front building line of the original mews structure) to include a shallow first floor balcony at the front of the mews house facing to the south-east which will be obscured by a full height glass screen at first floor level, to prevent overlooking onto the lane, behind which the existing first floor windows will be replaced with full height glazed doors. (c) construction of a new three storey extension (two storey plus the new barrel-vaulted attic/second floor level) to the rear of the mews house, with sliding glazed doors opening into the rear garden at ground level and a glass brise soleil on the rear facade at first floor level. (d) provision of a roof terrace at the rear of the mews house at second floor level facing to the north-east and north-west to be surrounded by a raised planted area and a 1.5m high obscured glazing privacy screen (to prevent overlooking). (e) replacement of the two existing garage spaces and central entrance hall accessing Percy Lane with a single larger garage space and relocated larger entrance hall, with the ground floor front facade to be clad in timber and glass, including a 3.3m wide timber 'up and over' inwards opening garage door, and various other internal changes including the provision of a wheelchair accessible lift to all floors. (f) construction of a new 1.8m high (approximate) rear boundary wall, and all associated site works; all within the curtilage of a protected structure. The gross floor space of the extended mews house will now be 241sq.m. (approximate gross floor space).\r\n",

Ref. 2227/15) on a site of 0.825 hectares at the Former Veterinary College site, Shelbourne Road, and No. 126 Pembroke Road, Ballsbridge, Dublin 4.\r\nThe development will consist of: the change of use of the permitted cultural unit (100 sq m at First Floor Level of Block 2) to office use; the change of use of the permitted cultural use's access stairs at Ground Floor Level (20 sq m) to retail use (at Retail Unit No. 1a); the change of use of permitted Retail Unit No. 3 fronting New Pembroke Street North (100 sq m) to cultural use; and an increase in size of the permitted office ESB substation and associated adjacent areas fronting Shelbourne Lane by 103 sq m (comprising 48 sq m ESB Substation, 35 sq m storage and 20 sq m circulation space), resulting in a reduction in the size of permitted Retail Unit No. 1a fronting New Pembroke Street East by 83 sq m. Associated minor alterations to the development are proposed to facilitate the proposed amendments. \r\nThe development will also consist of minor amendments to the Ground Floor Level to reflect the development granted planning permission under DCC Reg.

This application relates to proposed development within the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone. Part of the site is within a Conservation Area. Construction traffic will access the facility from New Wapping Street via an existing private internal access road passing beneath Sheriff Street. During the operational phase, coaches will access the facility from a new entrance on Park Lane connecting to the existing internal access road. The development will include repairs and minor expansion to the surface of the concrete hardstand and internal access road (1.7 hectares), together with incorporation of single storey portacabin building for security and welfare facility (72m2), lighting, CCTV, vehicle management controls and signage, bus bay line markings, installation of drainage control infrastructure and alterations to existing boundary hoarding at Park Lane entrance (to facilitate vehicle access and egress). The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts, etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility on a temporary basis until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "A temporary accommodation and parking facility for up to 50 private coaches in delineated bus bays on existing concrete hardstand. This application relates to proposed development within the North Lotts and Grand Canal Dock Strategic Development Zone. Part of the site is within a Conservation Area. Construction traffic will access the facility from New Wapping Street via an existing private internal access road passing beneath Sheriff Street. During the operational phase, coaches will access the facility from a new entrance on Park Lane connecting to the existing internal access road. The development will include repairs and minor expansion to the surface of the concrete hard-stand and internal access road (1.7 hectares), together with incorporation of single storey portacabin building for security and welfare facility (72 sq.m), lighting, CCTV, vehicle management controls and signage, bus bay line markings, installation of drainage control infrastructure and alterations to existing boundary hoarding at Park Lane entrance (to facilitate vehicle access and egress). The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility on a temporary basis until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved.\r\n",

At the upper floors above reception, additional activity room accommodation would be provided. A further lift would be provided to create access to the existing reception within Beneavin Lodge. Access to the basement would be by way of a ramp parallel to the playing field boundary from the newly created access road off Beneavin Road, approved under planning ref. 3602/14. The basement parking would allow the removal of surface parking provision which would be converted to landscaped amenity space. The proposal also covers the demolition of the single storey element of the existing entrance foyer and adjacent day room, to create an open landscaped secure courtyard which is a feature of existing care provision across the campus. Additionally the proposal would seek to extend the December 2014 approved scheme(ref. 3602/14) which provided for residential nursing care accommodation for those suffering from dementia, by the addition of new end of life palliative care suites with new ground floor reception and GP office, sluice and activity rooms at upper floors over, and a basement with plant rooms, storage, lift and stairs providing access to and from the basement parking noted previously. The proposal would also include for the provision of a new pedestrian entrance off Beneavin Road to Beneavin Lodge reception and cover alterations to storm and foul drainage and high quality hard and soft landscaping at surface level. Parking would be commensurate with current DCC guidelines, and disability access would be provided for through-out the scheme.\r\n",
