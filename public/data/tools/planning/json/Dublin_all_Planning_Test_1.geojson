The proposed sixth floor level is set back from Charlemont Street to follow the western and southern frontages of the building facing the main internal east-west and north-south streets that connect to the public plaza to the south of the proposed building.\r\nBlock 3: Amendments to Block 3 comprise a reconfiguration of residential unit layouts and types together with the removal of an internal core (no.7). These changes have resulted in a revised residential unit mix whereby the previously permitted number of 1 bed units are increased from 12 to 14; the number of two bedrooms are increased from 42 to 54; the number of 3 bed units decrease from 17 to 9 and the number of 4 bed units decrease from 4 to 2 resulting in an overall increase of 4 residential units from no. 75 to 79 to provide 14 no. 1 bed, 54 no. 2 bed, 9 no. 3 bed, 2 no. 4 bed units. A reduction of 146.7 sq.m of gross residential floorspace (from the previously permitted residential floor area of 7,993.2sq.m to 7,846.5sq.m) together with associated external alterations to the southern and western elevations of Block 3.\r\n",

The works to facilitate this include replacing timber floors with concrete floors, the provision of new internal sanctions and the replacement of the roof to match the existing roof.  The internal layout is to be remodelled.  The front elevation will remain unchanged.  Windows on the front and side elevation are to be replaced.  Existing white single-glazed PVC windows are to be removed and replaced with new white double-glazed windows.  The fenestration is to match the existing.  The boiler house and part of the rear wall is to be demolished and a new wall and lift shaft is to be constructed with revised fenestration.  One window on the third floor side elevation is to be enlarged to match the adjacent windows.  Muckross Park is a Protected Structure and the former school building is within the curtilage of the Protected Structure.\r\n",

It is proposed to demolish part of the currently vacant former four storey secondary school building (1548sq. metres in extent) and redundant outhouses attached to the convent and convert this area into a landscaped garden. Following this demolition a new elevation including new windows will be constructed on the rear elevation of the adjoining building now exposed. This building was previously approved as 12 residential units (Register Reference 2592/12). It is proposed to provide a new entrance/porch and electricity meter room on this newly exposed elevation. Parking spaces are to be provided adjacent to the landscaped garden. Permission is also sought for a new roof treatment to incorporate fixtures required to comply with Fire and Building Regulations. It is not part of this application but it is also proposed (as required by an earlier permission) to remove all three adjoining pre-fabricated classroom blocks and restore this area to grass. Muckross House is a protected structure and the redundant former school buildings to be demolished, are within the curtilage of the Protected Structure. The works are intended to improve the setting of the Protected Structure.",
