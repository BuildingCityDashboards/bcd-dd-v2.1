        "DevelopmentDescription" : "Dodder Greenway Route Scheme comprising: The proposed Dodder Greenway is being  developed to be a Greenway of international renown and to be on a par with the best greenways in the world. Although developed as a combination of off road and on road it utilises existing facilities within the Dodder Valley as much as possible to connect the linear parkland along the route. The main elements of the proposed Greenway are as follows:  • The Greenway route is approximately 14km in length and passes along the Dodder Valley from Orwell / Terenure through the outer suburbs of Tallaght to rural and upland Dublin to the entrance to the Bohernabreena reservoirs at Glenasmole.\r\n• It will provide for improved connectivity to communities, facilities and local business along the Dodder Valley corridor with a dedicated signage strategy.\r\n• Where commuting currently exists and demand is anticipated to continue, the scheme either ensures it is facilitated in a pedestrian priority environment with additional capacity for safe use at junctions or provide an alternative route for commuting cyclists where required.\r\n• The Greenway will generally consist of a shared 3-4m wide bound surface on the off road sections, tying into suitable bound surfacing for the on road sections. It is proposed to utilise enhanced variations to reflect local context.\r\n• Works will include widening and upgrade to existing paths, construction of new paths, the construction of a number of new bridges, upgrade of existing bridges and underpasses, junction upgrades, etc.\r\n• The upgrade and creation of new entrances to the Greenway.\r\n• Improved landscape treatment to provide a coherent and legible Greenway along the proposed Greenway.\r\n• Ecological enhancements including species rich grassland management, the planting of native trees and the provision of bat boxes.\r\n• Bat friendly public lighting will be provided both in new areas and in upgrading sections of existing lighting.\r\n• CCTV will be provided at a number of locations including each of the bridges.\r\n• Drainage measures including swales, signage, markings and ancillary works.\r\nThe proposed works will comprise the following:\r\n    Bohernabreena to Old Bawn Road\r\n• Upgrade of existing entrances to proposed Greenway\r\n• Improved environment for pedestrians and cyclists in a traffic calmed environment within Bohernabreena car park\r\n• Re-alignment of the entrance within the curtilage of Bohernabreena Reservoir a Protected Structure, Map Reference No.395\r\n• Provision of traffic calming measures to cross the R114 into Kiltipper Park, at Ellensborough\r\n• Utilise existing shared surface through Kiltipper Park\r\n• Introduction of a new car park adjacent to Kiltipper Woods Care Centre.

The track also includes a 743 m Junior Circuit for younger cyclists. The main elements of the scheme are as follows;\r\nthe cycle track in the park provides an off-road and safe racing experience for young cyclists - cycle racing on public roads is currently seen by cycle clubs as an obstacle to the development of the sport because of the safety issues for children, due to greater traffic volumes and the competition for road space; \r\nthe site of the track will be enclosed with a 1.2 m high timber post and rail fence with a hedge and will have a gated access to prevent unauthorised access; \r\nthe proposed site for the track currently has excellent road access and nearby car-parking, which will allow it to operate as a National facility and become an important Tourist and Sports amenity within South Dublin; \r\nthe track can be used as a National Road Race cycle training facility; \r\nthe track would provide an additional facility and is hoped will attract many visitors to that part of the park, particularly tourists at the adjacent Caravan Park;  in addition to cycle racing, the track can be used for leisure cycling and as an additional walking route. \r\nThe site surrounding the proposed track currently consists of managed grasslands which will help to screen any hard surfacing when viewed from other parts of the park. It is envisaged that when completed the facility could also be used as a Traffic School for teaching young children with particular emphasis on safety and best practice.

Vehicular access to serve the proposed development will be provided via two new access points off Garter Lane and via a new signalised junction at the southeastern corner of the site to replace the existing roundabout off Fortunestown Lane. Provision is made for a future access to Bianconi Avenue. In addition, an interim local square is proposed within the subject site providing a direct pedestrian link from the proposed development to the Saggart Luas stop. Two direct pedestrian links are proposed between the subject site and the adjoining school sites permitted under Reg Ref No SD16A/0255 providing a direct link between the school and the proposed district park and a direct link from the west of the school site to the proposed residential development. Lands identified for future development are located along the southern boundary of the current application site adjacent to Fortunestown Lane/Saggart Luas Stop. These areas will be subject of a future planning application (Phase 2) and will include the final design and layout of the local square.",
