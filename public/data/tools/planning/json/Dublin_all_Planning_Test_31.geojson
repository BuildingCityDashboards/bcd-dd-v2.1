        "DevelopmentDescription" : "The proposed development comprises of the construction of the Tobermaclugg foul water pumping station and the construction of twin rising mains, a storm water culvert, a foul water sewer and a temporary haul road, as described within the Adamstown Planning Scheme.  The development consists of the construction of both below ground and above ground structures:  above ground, a single storey building of 158.8m2 is to be constructed with a basement level dry well and an overall separate structure of 96.6m2 and 3.148m in height.  The proposed development also includes two underground storm-water holding tanks with a combined capacity of 2,400m3.  These will be concrete structures covered with a concrete slab at ground level of approx. 485m2 in total.  The proposed development requires the partial culverting and re-channelling of the Tobermaclugg Stream.  It is also proposed to erect a 1.8m boundary fence consisting of metal railing with a black powder-coated finish on the southern, northern and western boundaries of the site of the pumping station.  Vehicular access to the proposed pumping station will be via a new 6m wide gated vehicular access in the existing stone wall on the Tubber Lane Road.  the proposed development also includes c.406m of 500mm dia and 350mm dia twin rising mains extending south from the pumping station building; c.375m of foul water sewer which will tie into the foul sewer permitted under planning Reg. Ref. SDZ05a/2; and a temporary haul road from the site of the proposed pumping station, along Tobermaclugg stream.  The temporary haul road is intended to facilitate laying of the pipe work associated with this development, and it will be removed and the lands restored following completion of the proposed development.  Site development and landscaping works also form part of this application.  \r\n\r\nThis application is being made in accordance with the provisions of the Adamstown Planning Scheme 2003.  The lands fall entirely within the boundaries of Adamstown Strategic Development Zone as defined by Statutory Instrument No. 272 of 2001.\r\n",

Unit One has a gross floor area of 5,997.3sq.m. which includes a garden centre with a gross floor area of 844sq.m. and a mezzanine floor with a gross floor area of 1,358sq.m.  Unit Two is the discount foodstore.  Units Three-Five each have a gross floor area of 821sq.m.  Unit Six has a gross floor area of 1,376sq.m.  The maximum height of the retail units is approximately 10 metres.  The proposed development will be accessed off the existing internal access road to the Fonthill Industrial Park.  It is proposed to upgrade the access road into the Fonthill Industrial Park.  The upgraded road will consist of two vehicle lanes in both directions from the existing entrance roundabout on Fonthill Road to a new roundabout which will provide access to the subject site.  The new access road will have lay bys and traffic calming measures.  There will be a new access arrangement off the existing road running along the western boundary of the site to the proposed service yards located to the rear of the retail units.  The proposed development includes the demolition of the existing security hut and the development of a new security hut.  The proposed development includes the reconfiguration of gates, walls and fencing at the entrance to the Fonthill Industrial Park.  The entire development is to be served by 516 surface car parking spaces.  The proposed development includes all site development works including landscaping and boundary treatment, bicycle parking, an ESB substation, service yards, sprinkler tank, pump house and associated signage.  An EIS will be submitted to the Planning Authority with the planning application,  all on a 4.8 hectare site situated to the southwest of the junction of the Fonthill Road and the Coldcut Road.",

Access to the bridge structure from the southern side is to be provided by Iarnrod Eireann in accordance with their level crossing closure programme and in tandem with the Kildare Route Project.  The proposed over-bridge will provide a c.7.4m wide deck (with 6m wide carriageway) on 12.5m wide abutments at either end and will facilitate agricultural traffic only via a gate at the Northern end of the bridge deck.  This is required to maintain an existing right of way between agricultural lands to the south and a farm holding to the north.
