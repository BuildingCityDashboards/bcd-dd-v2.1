(the original permission permits a warehouse building [530sqm] with yard for the purposes of storage/transhipment of goods associated with the warehouse use). Development now proposed consists of a waste recycling and recovery facility for the processing of up to 45,000 tonnes of waste per annum, consisting of three waste streams namely:  Hydrocarbon Contaminated Waste (including interceptor waste, oily water, waste oil, coolants, cutting fluids, fuel oils and tank bottoms); Process/Industrial Wastes (including drain cleaning waste, acid/alkaline waste, neutralized waste, lime sludge leachate, process wash waters and bilge waste) and oil-contaminated solid materials (including spent oil filters and oily rags). It is also proposed that the facility be used for the short term storage of contaminated soils in skips and bulk bags at quantities not exceeding 1,000 tonnes per annum. The proposed development also consists of the completion of the concreting and bunding of the existing yards (which are partially already concreted and bunded) for purposes associated with the Waste Recycling and Recovering Facility; the provision of 4 no. external bunded storage tanks; internal alterations to provide for a kitchen (9sqm), changing and wash room (13sqm) and control room (15sqm) at ground floor level and the addition of a laboratory at first floor level (14sqm) in the existing building giving a total floor area of 565sqm (including stair cores and circulation space) which is now to be used primarily for the processing and treatment of waste; 2 no. separate extensions to the east of the existing building, the first being approx. 36m long, 18.9m wide by 9.55m high (650sqm), into which deliveries of unprocessed waste (into 3 no. underground sumps) are to be made (prior to pumping into 3 no. above-ground storage tanks), and the second extension being approx. 5.4m long, 7.5m wide by 8.4m high (36sqm), to be used for the short term storage of unprocessed waste in bulk containers and empty containers prior to removal off site. Both the proposed extensions are to match the existing building in external finish. The development also includes the provision of 1 no. weighbridge; 1 no. wash bay; 11 no. car parking spaces; modifications to the existing surface and foul drainage; landscaping; the demolition of 7.25m of existing rendered block wall for the purposes of widening an internal entrance within the site, and all other necessary site development and excavation works above and below ground.

The proposed building will initially be used as a marketing suite and information facility for the development of Adamstown District Centre. Upon cessation of its intended use as a marketing suite and information facility, the building will regain its office (Class 3) use. The proposed building contains c.2,488sqm of office space with additional c.532sqm of circulation and back-up areas, including plant rooms, bin stores, canteen, toilets switch and comms. rooms and lift/stair cores. Permission is also sought for the construction of a temporary car park incorporating 100 spaces on the western side of Adamstown Boulevard, to the west of the proposed linear park. The car park is required for the period in which the building is in use as a marketing suite and information centre, and car parking for the development will eventually be provided as part of a future application for planning permission within the overall Adamstown District Centre site on lands immediately to the south of the application site. Temporary drainage and services connections are also being provided to serve this building. It is proposed to temporarily connect to the permitted network of watermains to the south of the proposed building on the 300mm Dia main, which will revert to a hydrant when the Planning Application is submitted for the surrounding area. A temporary foul rising main will discharge into existing sewers at the junction of Adamstown Park and Adamstown Avenue. The building will ultimately connect to the required services infrastructure to be provided as part of the development of the remaining sections of the Adamstown Square development area, subject to future application(s) for planning permission. Site development and landscape works are also proposed as part of this application. The planning application is being made in accordance with the provisions of the Adamstown Planning Scheme 2003. The development will take place entirely within the boundaries of Adamstown Strategic Development Zone as defined by Statutory Instrument No. 272 of 2001. This is to be developed on the site of 0.5315ha on lands bounded generally by Adamstown Avenue to the south (SDZ06A/11), Adamstown Boulevard to the west (SDZ06A/11) (the proposed temporary car park is located immediately to the west of Adamstown Boulevard), Adamstown Way (SDZ06A/5) to the north, in the townlands of Finnstown and Adamstown, Lucan, Co.
