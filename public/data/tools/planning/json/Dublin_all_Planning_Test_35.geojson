The development will consist of the continued use (including refurbishment and remodelling) of 18,958 sq.m. and the development of an additional 2,013 sq.m. resulting in a scheme with a total gross floorspace of 20,971 sq.m. excluding car parking at basement, ground, first floor levels (17,371 sq.m.) (the existing centre measures some 18,958 sq.m. gross floor area (33,219 sq.m.) including basement car parking).   The proposed development will include some reorganisation of existing floorspace, which results in a change of use from:  public house to retail (203 sq.m.);  public house to ancillary (215 sq.m.);  public house to cinema (16 sq.m.);  non-retail services to retail (96 sq.m.);  off-licence to retail (150 sq.m.);  office to retail (279 sq.m.);  office to cinema (313 sq.m.);  office to ancillary (21 sq.m.);  and ancillary to retail (99 sq.m.).   The proposed development will consist of:  an increase in retail use by 1,060 sq.m. gross retail area (863 sq.m. net retail sales area (from 7,585 sq.m. to 8,645 sq.m. gross retail area in total (5,643 sq.m. to 6,506 sq.m. net retail area in total));  an increase in ancillary space by 597 sq.m. (from 2,685 sq.m. to 3,282 sq.m.) (ancillary space includes areas such as service corridors, circulation, toilets, staff areas, plant areas, substations and switchrooms);  a decrease in office use by 596 sq.m. (from 2,502 sq.m. to 1,906 sq.m.);  a decrease in non-retail services by 96 sq.m. (from 851 sq.m. to 755 sq.m.);  a decrease in public bars by 2,477 sq.m. (from 3,209 sq.m. to 732 sq.m.);  the provision of an 7-screen, 1,397 no. seat cinema (3,525 sq.m.), including associated ancillary ticket sales, concessions, lobbies and circulation areas, toilets and administration areas;  and an increase in car parking provision by 101 no. spaces (from 541 no. to 642 no. spaces) attributable to the slight reorganisation of space at basement level and the provision of a multi-storey car parking area at ground, first and second floor levels.   The scheme ranges in height from 2 to 4 storeys all over an existing basement level.    The development also includes:  the relocation of existing vehicular access / egress point via Whitehall Road West, the continued use of the existing vehicular access / egress point via Cromwellsfort Road and the continued use of pedestrian (including disabled) access;  the provision of all hard and soft landscaping;  lifts / travellators;  cycle parking;  plant areas;  associated signage;  changes in level;  boundary treatments;  associated elevational changes;  and all other associated site excavation and site development works above and below ground.\r\n",

The development is served by an existing vehicular access point off Stratton Walk (to the north of the site) leading to the underground car park, which accommodates 101 no. car parking spaces.  An existing substation on the site will be maintained in it's current location.  The development includes all ancillary site works and services, including 3 no. additional on-street car parking spaces, bicycle parking, refuse stores and collection point and associated landscaping.  The development also involves the retention of a very minor change to the alignment of Stratton Walk involving a slight curve in the road carriageway in order to facilitate a full-length driveway for each existing house on the northern side of the road.

(the original permission permits a warehouse building [530sqm] with yard for the purposes of storage/transhipment of goods associated with the warehouse use). Development now proposed consists of a waste recycling and recovery facility for the processing of up to 45,000 tonnes of waste per annum, consisting of three waste streams namely:  Hydrocarbon Contaminated Waste (including interceptor waste, oily water, waste oil, coolants, cutting fluids, fuel oils and tank bottoms); Process/Industrial Wastes (including drain cleaning waste, acid/alkaline waste, neutralized waste, lime sludge leachate, process wash waters and bilge waste) and oil-contaminated solid materials (including spent oil filters and oily rags). It is also proposed that the facility be used for the short term storage of contaminated soils in skips and bulk bags at quantities not exceeding 1,000 tonnes per annum. The proposed development also consists of the completion of the concreting and bunding of the existing yards (which are partially already concreted and bunded) for purposes associated with the Waste Recycling and Recovering Facility; the provision of 4 no. external bunded storage tanks; internal alterations to provide for a kitchen (9sqm), changing and wash room (13sqm) and control room (15sqm) at ground floor level and the addition of a laboratory at first floor level (14sqm) in the existing building giving a total floor area of 565sqm (including stair cores and circulation space) which is now to be used primarily for the processing and treatment of waste; 2 no. separate extensions to the east of the existing building, the first being approx. 36m long, 18.9m wide by 9.55m high (650sqm), into which deliveries of unprocessed waste (into 3 no. underground sumps) are to be made (prior to pumping into 3 no. above-ground storage tanks), and the second extension being approx. 5.4m long, 7.5m wide by 8.4m high (36sqm), to be used for the short term storage of unprocessed waste in bulk containers and empty containers prior to removal off site. Both the proposed extensions are to match the existing building in external finish. The development also includes the provision of 1 no. weighbridge; 1 no. wash bay; 11 no. car parking spaces; modifications to the existing surface and foul drainage; landscaping; the demolition of 7.25m of existing rendered block wall for the purposes of widening an internal entrance within the site, and all other necessary site development and excavation works above and below ground. The application relates to development which comprises and is for the purposes of an activity requiring a waste license in accordance with the Waste Management Act, 1996.
