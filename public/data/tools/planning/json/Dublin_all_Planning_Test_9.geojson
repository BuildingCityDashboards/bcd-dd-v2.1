The proposed development will consist of external and internal amendments to a previously permitted development under DCC Reg. Ref. 3847/16 (ABP Ref. PL29S.248181) together with the omission of Condition 7 attached (and consequential amendment of Condition 8 attached, which refers to Condition 7) through a revised design of shopfronts at ground floor level to include for framing within which external signage can be applied at fascia level. Details of such signage will be the subject of separate planning application(s) for the consideration and approval of the Planning Authority. Other external alterations include the provision of a revised rooftop layout to provide an increased open rooftop plant area (increase of approximately 369 sq.m in area) to accommodate relocated internal plant from 5th floor level. It is also proposed to increase the height of the permitted plant screen from a permitted level of 34.05m to a height ranging between level 34.7m and 35.0m (an increase ranging between 0.65m and 0.95m in height). A revised elevational treatment to both the Nassau Street and Dawson Street elevations together with amended corner treatment to main retail entrance and revised office entrance onto Dawson Street is proposed. The proposed internal alterations include a reduction in the extent of the previously approved basement and a revised configuration/layout of the basement to provide revised circulation cores; changing facilities; bicycle storage provision; store rooms; and car parking layout. The proposed number of car parking spaces is reduced from 44 spaces to 30 spaces and the number of bicycle parking spaces is reduced from 172 spaces to 170 spaces. Provision is made for 9 no. motorcycle parking spaces at basement level. Reduction in the extent of the lower ground floor level to include a reduction of Retail Unit 3 by approximately 253 sq.m (GFA). General reconfiguration of ground floor layout to provide reconfigured main office entrance, foyer layout and goods lift and relocation of double doors onto Dawson Street in a position north of its permitted location. Changes to the configuration of the main retail entrance onto the corner of Nassau and Dawson Streets and the layout of retail units to include the provision of 4 No. retail units at ground floor level in addition to the retained, existing Unit 2 at 60-63 Dawson Street that will continue to be used as a creperie/restaurant pursuant to DCC Planning Permission Ref. 4898/04. Alteration to first floor layout to retail units, including the relocation of the void above the revised office foyer location at ground floor level below and a reduction of approximately 27 sq.m (GFA) of retail floorspace. Alteration to second, third and fourth floor office layouts to provide a reduced atrium and increased office floor space and omission and relocation of internal plant at fifth floor level to roof top level together with a commensurate change of use to office floorspace to provide an additional 241 sq.m of office floorspace at 5th floor level. In the interest of clarity, the proposed amendments would result in an overall reduction of floorspace from an approved 22,837 sq.m (GFA) to 22,268 sq.m (GFA) - a reduction of 569 sq.m (GFA). However, the proposed amendments would result in an overall increase of approximately 473 sq.m (GFA) in office floorspace and a reduction in retail floorspace by approximately 255 sq.m (GFA) due to proposed internal amendments and reconfigured layouts.",

It is proposed to relocate the Cumberland Road entrance and associated lift core to the north west of its permitted location resulting in a reconfiguration of both the internal layouts at all levels and the associated street parking configuration, maximizing the frontage to the canal amenity. \r\nMinor reconfigurations are also proposed to additional core areas and ancillary service areas. Amendments to building setbacks are also proposed including a further 1.2m setback at ground and first floor levels to the east facade on the corner of Cumberland Road and Wilton Terrace, and a further 1.1m setback at ground and lower ground floors west of the proposed entrance location on Wilton Terrace and a reduction in the setback to Lad Lane at the north east corner of the site at levels 4 and 5 by 1.5m resulting in a reduced setback of 6m. Elevational modifications are also proposed arising from the proposed amendments and include the removal of fins from structural glazing at first floor level either side of the main entrance and an increase in the parapet heights by c.350. In addition a revised setback roof plant to tenant specification with associated visual and acoustic screening varying in height from 2.7m to a maximum of 4.1m (total height c.37.37m an increase of c.970mm and increase in area by c.90 m2, from c.520 m2 to c.610 m2)is also proposed.\r\nArising from the relocation of plant equipment from basement to roof level, enlarged cycle parking and changing facilities are proposed at basement level. In addition, it is proposed to provide a dedicated bicycle stair & single direction vehicle ramp to the basement. Other modifications include the provision of new break-out areas to feature bridge at 1st, 3rd, 5th and 6th floor levels, revision to the permitted landscaping including gardens and terraces at lower ground, ground, 4th, 7th and roof levels and all ancillary development and site works above and below ground.

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "Development at a site of c.0.135 ha at Fitzwilliam Street Lower (and bound to the rear (east) by James's Street East). The development relates to proposed modifications to part of the wider redevelopment of lands at Nos. 13-30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Dublin 2 comprising most of a city block bounded by Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Mount Street Upper, James's Street East and Baggot Street Lower permitted under An Bord Plean√°la Reference PL29S.244492 (Dublin City Council Reference 3052/14) currently under construction, and as amended by Dublin City Council References 4428/17, 2059/18. The proposed development relates to 2 no. parcels within the wider ESB redevelopment namely the north eastern corner of Block A, and the south eastern corner of Block B; both of which address James's Street East.\r\nUnder the parent permission, office and associated ancillary uses are permitted in these blocks. The proposed works relate to Levels 00, Level Lower Ground, Level -01 and Level -02 only. Internal layout reconfiguration is proposed at the Block A parcel north of the permitted courtyard. This includes the relocation of electrical plant rooms from Level 00 (Ground Floor) to Level -01, and associated relocation of office space from Level -01 to Level 00. Associated modifications to fenestration at the north side of the courtyard include the installation of louvred doors to plant rooms at Level -01 and the installation of fenestration at Level 00 to align with the facade treatment of other office space in the development along James's Street East. An additional storage room (12 sq.m) is also proposed to the east of the internal stairs in Block A along the James's Street East boundary. External stairs are proposed to provide access from James's Street East to the proposed plant rooms at courtyard level (Level -01). Associated minor modifications to the permitted landscaping of the courtyard are proposed. At the Block B parcel, it is proposed to relocate electrical plantroom from the west side to the east side of the courtyard at level -01 with associated reduction of internal floorspace (-21 sq.m) at mezzanine Lower Ground Level. An associated enlargement of the courtyard area at level -01 is proposed (25 sq.m) with a subsequent reduction in courtyard area at level -02 (-25 sq.m). The latter results in an enlarged Test Lab (40 sq.m) at Level -02. At Level -01, an internal access stairs to the south of the courtyard will be replaced with an external stair providing access from Courtyard Level -01 to James's Street East at Ground Floor (Level 00). The net additional floorspace arising from the proposed modifications outlined above is 16 sq.m.",
