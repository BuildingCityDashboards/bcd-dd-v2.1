The proposed development primarily affects the Napper Tandy site to provide a mixed use scheme of office accommodation and a student university hostel (designed to cater for third level and forth level students as well as for visiting academics). The proposed development will consist of the redesign and change of use of the permitted eight storey over basement building on the Napper Tandy site to provide an eight storey building (reduced in height by 1.05 m from that permitted under Reg. Ref. 3155/09 (PL29S.234520)) accommodating: office use (97 sq m) and ancillary student university hostel uses (88 sq m) at ground floor level, with seven storeys of student university hostel accommodation (1,386 sq m) above comprising 46 No. suites (37 No. single and 9 No. twin suites ranging in size from 19 sq m to 25 sq m), together with ancillary facilities including associated plant/solar panels and landscaped open space at roof level, provision of photovoltaic panels on the southern elevation, associated signage and an entrance canopy over the Chancery Lane footpath; and omission of the basement (146 sq m) permitted under Reg. Ref. 3155/09 (PL29S.234520). The total gross floor area of the permitted building on the Napper Tandy site is increased from 1,533 sq m to 1,571 sq m.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "PROTECTED STRUCTURE: For development on part of the Guinness Brewery lands to the north of James's Street, Dublin 8 (The subject site contains two Protected Structures - granite piers and the Guinness Building on Victoria Quay known as Victoria Quay House). The subject site is bound by Victoria Quay to the north and Watling Street to the east, and existing brewery areas to the south and west. The proposed development comprises of the construction of a new brewhouse and a consolidation of existing brewery uses, including the relocation of existing Brewhouse functions from Guinness Brewery lands to the south of James's Street. The proposed development will have a combined overall floor area of approx 12,008sq.m. The development includes the demolition of six existing structures with a combined floor area of 3,124 approx sq.m. These buildings include a disused fire damaged Lager Plant (1389 sq.m) Mechanical Maintenance Workshop (610 sq.m), Electrical Maintenance Workshop (275 sq.m), Fork Lift Maintenance Workshop (180 sq.m) Staff Facilitates Building (245 sq.m), and a disused Utilities Pumphouse (425 sq.m).\r\n\r\nThe development comprises:\r\nThe provision of a new relocated upgraded Brewhouse Building will increase the annual output capacity of the brewery to 8.2 million hl (hectolitre) and with an overall floor area of approx 9,314 sq.m. The output capacity of the existing brewery is approx 5.0 million hl. This building will generally be of two stories with a height of approximately 14.1M (18.3M OD), with an associated grain intake facility and silo structure with a height of approximately 25.1M (29.3M OD) on the east face of the building, together with a flue stack with a height of approx 28.1M (32.34MOD), and a series of tank structures containing 23 tanks with a maximum height of approximately 25.8M (30.0MOD) on the west face of the building. The dimensions of the proposed building are approx. 113M x 90M.\r\n\r\nAn extension of approx 2,087 sq.m to the existing Fermentation and Beer Processing Plant. This extension will be located on the western side of the existing Plant Building, and will continue the form of the existing building, with a single storey podium supporting a series of fermentation tank structures, with a maximum height of approx. 19.15M (24.6MOD). \r\n\r\nThe provision at the existing Central Utilities Area of a new incoming Water Treatment Plantroom, with a floor area of approx 280 sq.m, two associated external storage tanks, and associated plant. The Plantroom height will be approx 7.0M (13.26MOD) and the maximum tank height will be approx 9.0M (15.26M OD).\r\n\r\nIncreasing the capacity of the existing Waste Water Treatment plant by the addition of two new treatment tanks, with a maximum height of approx 8.1M (11.3 MOD), and associated plant. This will include the provision of a screening building enclosure on the Walting Street frontage, with a floor area of 327dq.m, and a height of roof ridge level of approximately 9.8M (13.0MOD). \r\n\r\nThere are no car parking spaces proposed as part of this development. A new internal one way road network will be provided within the site. Vehicular access to the proposed development will be via the existing brewery access on Victoria Quay. Two temporary construction vehicular access points are proposed at existing gateways on Victoria Quay.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to upgrade the existing Victoria Quay boundary wall from its starting point adjacent to the corner with Walting Street as far as the existing vehicular access gateway to the brewery, to incorporate 32no. feature lights mounted on the existing piers. These works will include facade upgrading of the Guinness Building on Victoria Quay, and restoration works to the gateway piers, both of which are Protected Structures. The works include insertion of two new sets of non functioning gates into two number existing gateways. The proposed gates will include the harp symbol and the Guinness logo. Works to the wall will include provision of viewing slots through the wall towards the new Brewhouse at strategic locations. It is also proposed to insert 12 no. viewing slots approx. 450mm wide in the Victoria Quay boundary wall. \r\n\r\nThe Brewhouse grain intake tower structure will incorporate externally illuminated Guinness Harp logo signage at a high level on all sides. The north facade of the Brewhouse facing Victoria Quay includes a glazed gallery which will incorporate an internally illuminated Guinness logo sign. The south facade of the Brewhouse will include externally illuminated Guinness logo and harp symbol signage.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development includes all associated site development works, internal site  lighting and landscaping. All of the above is proposed on a site of approx. 26,960 sq.m (2.7 hectares). \r\n\r\nAn Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has been prepared in respect of this planning application. The application relates to development which is for the purposes of an activity requiring an Integrated Pollution Prevention Control (IPPC) Licence.\r\n",
