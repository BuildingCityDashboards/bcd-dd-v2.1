Furthermore works also include the modification of c. 700sq.m. of the 0.8ha area of Site A which will comprise the removal of gravel and stone material (140 cubic metres) to be replaced with topsoil and subsoil (140 cubic metres). The gravel/stone material will be re-distributed to Area 5 of Site B.  Following these works Area 1 of Site A will be reseeded and returned to agriculture use. Site B encompasses the southern part of the subject application site and the proposed works subject of this applicaiton comprise the retention of an access road to provide access to forestry land for the purpose of allowing permanent access for maintenance and emergency vehicles.  The access road is constructed with inert materials including soil and subsoil material (permitted under South Dublin County Council Waste Permit WPR 040).  The modification and completion of this access road will comprise the removal of part of the access road to the south and centre of the application lands, referred to in the application as Area 2 and Area 4 and the redistribution of this fill material to an area north of Site B referred to as Area 5 (c. 1000sq.m.) where infilling of this area (Area 5) will occur.  The volume of the inert soil fill material subject of the removal and distribution will total c. 763 cubic metres. Following the removal of the proposed subject areas of the internal access road and excess fill material, re-grading and landscaping works will be undertaken in keeping with the surrounding lands.  The subject application site is divided in two distinct areas referred to in the planning application as Site A and Site B. The northern part of the applicaiton site is referred to as Site A and encompasses Area 1.",
