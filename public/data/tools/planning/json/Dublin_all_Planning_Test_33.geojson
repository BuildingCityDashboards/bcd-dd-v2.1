        "DevelopmentDescription" : "Construction of phase one of the Adamstown District Centre.  The application site incorporates elements of Adamstown Square, Adamstown Boulevard and Adamstown Station Development Areas within the Adamstown SDZ.  The proposed development is a large scale mixed use commercial and residential development of c.109,044sq.m. in total  to be constructed in buildings ranging in height from 2-10storeys, based on a network of open streets and public squares, some of which sit above a previously permitted podium structure (Planning reg. ref. SDZ07A/0003).  The non residential element of the development consists of a total of c.54,504sq.m. of floor space, broken down as follows:  (a) 48 no. retail units comprising c.16,294sq.m. of retail floor space (sales floor only), including 2 no. anchor units (10,375sq.m. in total), a pharmacy of c250sq.m. and an off licence of c154sq.m.  (b) A total of c.5,197sq.m. of back of house retail floor space including storage and staff facilities. (c) 9 no. restaurant / cafe units comprising a total of c.2,576sq.m. ranging in size from c.86sq.m. to c.685sq.m.  (d) 2 no. public houses of c.284sq.m. and c.357sq.m. respectively.  (e) c. 582sq.m. of office (Class 2) floor space contained in 4 no. units ranging in size from 122sq.m. to c.181sq.m..  (f) 9,327sq.m. of office (Class 3) floor space.  (g) A c.550sq.m. inter church place of worship.  (h) A primary medical centre of c.5,050sq.m. incorporating both public and private healthcare facilities.  (i)A crèche of c.682sq.m.  (i) An office for use by Garda Siochana of c.130sq.m.  (j)  A library and community service suite of c.2,804sq.m.  (k) A cinema of c. 2,226sq.m. incorporating a total of 8 screens and seating for a total of c. 1,304 people.  (l) A management Suite for the District Centre of c.351sq.m. including public toilets.  (j) A total of c.1,332sq.m. of space surrounding the service yard for Anchor unit A, the use of which is to be decided as part of a future application for planning permission on the levels above.  A total of c.6,762sq.m. of additional backup areas, including plant rooms, substations, switch rooms, bicycle stores, bin stores etc.    The residential element of the proposal comprises the provision of a total of 606 residential units, comprising 91 no. 1-bedroom units, 459 no. 2-bedroom units and 56 no. 3-bedroom units in a mix of apartments and duplexes.  3 no. of the 1-bedroom units have been provided as live/work units and have commercial floor space attached to them of between c.63.4sq.m. and c.69sq.m. each.  The residential units are located on levels above the commercial development.  Private and semi private open space to cater for the development is provided in a mix of balconies, terraces, roof terraces and semi-private residential courtyards.  A total of c.54,540sq.m. of gross residential floor space is proposed.  Minor revisions to the layout and configuration of the previously permitted basement structure (SDZ07A/3) was also proposed.  The modifications include the provision of additional openings in the basement slab to provide access to the upper levels; the provision of a parking layout and parking bays.  Car parking is to be provided primarily on a single level below podium with two additional mezzanine levels on the southern side.  The car park has been designed to cater for phase 1 and also subsequent phases of the District Centre together with provision for a number of the surrounding developments(subject to separate applications for planning permission).  A car park management system will be put in place and car parking spaces will therefore be released as each phase becomes ready for occupation.  The upper two storeys, which will cater for residential development only, comprise a total of 519sq.m. sq.m.  The lower floor, which will cater for both residential and non-residential demand, is located under the podium structure (Planning Reg. Ref. SDZ07A/0003) and contains a total of 1,539sq.m. no spaces.  Accommodation is made within the overall basement car park for a Park and Ride facility (300 spaces) and a car valeting area.  A total of 850 no., cycle parking spaces are provided throughout the development, to cater for both residential and commercial demand.  Access to the development is via that existing and permitted roads system in the immediate area (planning  reg. refs. SDZ06A/5, SDZ06A/8, SDZ09a/9 and SDZ06A/11 refer).  Localised widening of the existing Adamstown Station Road is also proposed, to provide for right turning lanes into the basement car park.  A series of internal pedestrian and vehicular streets are proposed, connecting to the existing and permitted road network.  A proposed pedestrian bridge spanning Adamstown Station Road will connect the proposed development to Adamstown Rail Station at first floor level.  Following completion of the proposed development, the use of the existing temporary park and ride facility on lands immediately to the east of the proposed development will be discontinued and park and ride facilities will be provided within the car park described above.  All on lands of c.7.95ha. bounded by Adamstown Avenue (SDZ06A/11) to the north, by Adamstown Station Road to the south, by Adamstown Park (SDZ06A/5) to the east and the existing temporary Park and ride to the west in the townlands of Gollierstown, Lucan, Co. Dublin.  This planning application is being made in accordance with the provisions of the Adamstown Planning Scheme 2003.
