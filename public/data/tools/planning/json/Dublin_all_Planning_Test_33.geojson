A total of c.6,762sq.m. of additional backup areas, including plant rooms, substations, switch rooms, bicycle stores, bin stores etc.    The residential element of the proposal comprises the provision of a total of 606 residential units, comprising 91 no. 1-bedroom units, 459 no. 2-bedroom units and 56 no. 3-bedroom units in a mix of apartments and duplexes.  3 no. of the 1-bedroom units have been provided as live/work units and have commercial floor space attached to them of between c.63.4sq.m. and c.69sq.m. each.  The residential units are located on levels above the commercial development.  Private and semi private open space to cater for the development is provided in a mix of balconies, terraces, roof terraces and semi-private residential courtyards.  A total of c.54,540sq.m. of gross residential floor space is proposed.  Minor revisions to the layout and configuration of the previously permitted basement structure (SDZ07A/3) was also proposed.  The modifications include the provision of additional openings in the basement slab to provide access to the upper levels; the provision of a parking layout and parking bays.  Car parking is to be provided primarily on a single level below podium with two additional mezzanine levels on the southern side.  The car park has been designed to cater for phase 1 and also subsequent phases of the District Centre together with provision for a number of the surrounding developments(subject to separate applications for planning permission).  A car park management system will be put in place and car parking spaces will therefore be released as each phase becomes ready for occupation.  The upper two storeys, which will cater for residential development only, comprise a total of 519sq.m. sq.m.  The lower floor, which will cater for both residential and non-residential demand, is located under the podium structure (Planning Reg. Ref. SDZ07A/0003) and contains a total of 1,539sq.m. no spaces.  Accommodation is made within the overall basement car park for a Park and Ride facility (300 spaces) and a car valeting area.  A total of 850 no., cycle parking spaces are provided throughout the development, to cater for both residential and commercial demand.  Access to the development is via that existing and permitted roads system in the immediate area (planning  reg. refs. SDZ06A/5, SDZ06A/8, SDZ09a/9 and SDZ06A/11 refer).  Localised widening of the existing Adamstown Station Road is also proposed, to provide for right turning lanes into the basement car park.  A series of internal pedestrian and vehicular streets are proposed, connecting to the existing and permitted road network.  A proposed pedestrian bridge spanning Adamstown Station Road will connect the proposed development to Adamstown Rail Station at first floor level.  Following completion of the proposed development, the use of the existing temporary park and ride facility on lands immediately to the east of the proposed development will be discontinued and park and ride facilities will be provided within the car park described above.  All on lands of c.7.95ha. bounded by Adamstown Avenue (SDZ06A/11) to the north, by Adamstown Station Road to the south, by Adamstown Park (SDZ06A/5) to the east and the existing temporary Park and ride to the west in the townlands of Gollierstown, Lucan, Co. Dublin.  This planning application is being made in accordance with the provisions of the Adamstown Planning Scheme 2003.  The development will take place entirely within the boundaries of Adamstown Strategic Development Zone as defined by Statutory Instrument No. 272 of 2001.An Environmental Impact Statement accompanies this planning application and may be inspected or purchased at a fee not exceeding the reasonable cost of making a copy at the offices of South Dublin County Council, Planning Department, County Hall, Tallaght, Dublin 24 during normal office house (Monday to Friday 9:30am to 4:00pm excluding bank holidays).\r\n",
