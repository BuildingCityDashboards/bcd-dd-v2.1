(In Receivership) (each acting by the Joint Receivers Mark Reynolds & Glenn Crann), Savills, 33 Molesworth Street, Dublin 2. Intend to apply for Planning Permission: For development at a site of 1.056  ha known as The former Boland's Mill incorporating 33 & 34 Barrow Street together with 35A Barrow Street & 35 Barrow Street (Car Park) at Ringsend Road and Barrow Street, Dublin 4, bounded to the north by Ringsend Rd., to the south by adjacent office development (Mason Hayes Curran (''South Bank House'') and the Warehouse), to the east by Barrow Street and to the west by Grand Canal Dock. The site accommodates 4 protected structures including; Block B referred to as 1 Ringsend Road (RPS 7377); Block D comprising nos. 33 and 34 Barrow Street (RPS 483, 484); two-storey brick gables of warehouses to south of Boland's Mill (the 'factory' building) (RPS 485). The proposed development seeks amendments to previously permitted Residential Building 3 permitted under DSDZ3796/14. The development consists of: Internal amendments and modifications to the permitted Residential Building 3 to provide for 5 no. additional apartment units increasing the overall no. of units from 31 units to 36 units comprising 35 no. of 2 bed units and 1 no. of 3 bed unit. The previously permitted scheme accommodated 30 no. 2 bed units and 1 no. 3 bed unit. The overall gfa of the building increases from 4,507 sq.m. to 4,849 sq.m. The additional units are facilitated by the creation of an additional floor at 15th floor through the reduction in the permitted ceiling heights by 90mm from 3100mm to 3010mm. The development proposes the omission of the semi enclosed roof terrace provided at 14th floor and the shared deck/terrace at 13th floor to facilitate the additional penthouse apartment over 14th and 15th floor and the additional apartment unit at 13th floor. Elevational amendments proposed to the north, east, south and west elevations and in particular revised treatment of the west elevation to provide a revised solid to void treatment. The shoulder parapets are increased from 45.55 to 47.41 and from 45.55 and 48.09 on all elevations. There is no increase to the height of the building.

PL29S.245492 - the 'parent permission') on a site of 0.24 hectares. The development proposes modifications to the permitted scheme which will consist of: the omission of the permitted Lower Basement Level (183 sq.m); an increase in the size of the permitted Basement Level by 50 sq.m (from 1,986 sq.m permitted to 2,036 sq.m now proposed); the reconfiguration of the internal layout of the permitted building from Basement to Eighth Floor Levels to include amendments to the office space, retail/ restaurant units, café unit, car and bicycle parking (which includes for a reduction in cycle parking spaces), ancillary space (ancillary space includes areas such as circulation cores (lifts and stairs)), plant areas throughout the building, electrical substations and switchrooms, toilets and shower areas etc.) etc.; the provisions of external lighting to the north east and west facades; alterations to the permitted roof terraces (permitted on the north elevation at the Fifth and Sixth Floor Levels and on the south elevation of the Fifth and Seventh  Floor Levels), including the provision of landscaping; reduction in the depths of the internal mullion thickness of the facade around the permitted building's perimeter; alterations to the permitted building's elevations at Ground Floor Level and upper levels; removal of the roof to the permitted plant room at Eighth Floor Level; extensions to the permitted panels screening the Eighth Floor Level plant areas; an increase in the height of the parapet on the roof of the Seventh Floor Level; and associated alterations to permitted hard and soft landscaping and permitted site servicing (foul and surface water drainage and water supply). The changes result in an increase in office floor area by 300 sq.m net internal floor area (9,654 sq.m permitted to 9,954 sq.m proposed), an increase in the retail/ restaurant floor area by 43 sq.m net internal floor area (214 sq.m and 418 sq.m, respectively, permitted to 300 sq.m and 375 sq.m respectively, proposed), an increase in ancillary floor area by 171 sq.m (from 2,425 sq.m permitted to 2,596 sq.m proposed) and a reduction in the size of the café by 122 sq.m net internal floor area (from 422 sq.m permitted to 300 sq.m proposed). The overall gross floor area of the building is proposed to increase from 13,279 sq.m (excluding Basement Level of 183 sq.m) as permitted to 13,525 sq.m (excluding the Basement Level of 2,036 sq.m) now proposed.",

All apartments are in accordance with required minimum floor areas. The existing buildings will have the roofs and the second floor attic space removed to be replaced with two new floors of residential accommodation making four storeys in total; the converted existing buildings will provide 1 no. 1-bedroom, 6 no. 2 bedroom, and 3 no. 3-bedroom apartments on the ground, first, second and third floors with ancillary secure bicycle parking (33m2), waste management (17m2) and storage (28m2) on the ground floor. All apartments have private east and south facing balconies. The new four storey building to the front has a ground floor cafe/bistro (132m2) with 6 no. 1-bedroom apartments and associated west facing terraces above. The apartments to the front and those in the existing rebuilt buildings area accessed via a four storey rooflit galleried atrium space with stairs and lift. To the rear of the site a new four storey apartment building is proposed. This accommodates 6 no. 1-bedroom, 4 no. 2-bedroom, and 1 no 3-bedroom apartments. The building has been designed to avoid overlooking from habitable rooms to existing development to the east. All apartments are accessed via stairs and lift. All apartments have private open space provided on west, south and north facing balconies and terraces. A new landscaped courtyard is proposed between the buildings to the front and the apartment building to the rear. This paved courtyard provides parking for 16 no. cars. Controlled vehicular access from Upper Drumcondra Road is via an existing vehicular entry and through a new archway to the southwest corner of the site. Extensively landscaped open space and gardens and children's play area are provided to the south, east and north of the site to the rear, adjacent to the rear four storey building. External finishes to the proposed buildings are of selected brick to match the context of the existing buildings to the public front together with brick and rendered walls to the rear elevations and new rear apartment building. All windows, doors and screens are to be of thermally broken aluminium framing with selected colour finish in agreement with the planning authority. The proposed surface water drainage system, as shown on the site layout, will be designed in accordance with the Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems requirements of Dublin City Council for permeable paving and rainwater attenuation areas. The surface water and foul sewer drainage will connect to the existing mains drainage in Upper Drumcondra Road.",

The new porch is to feature a gable-ended mono-pitched roof. Note the proposed new storeroom will be accessed only from the outside/ front garden;\r\n(iii) the revision of the treatment of part of the front elevation between the proposed new porch and the boundary wall, to consist of the relocation of the previously approved new window, and the omission of the previously approved door to the side access passage.",
