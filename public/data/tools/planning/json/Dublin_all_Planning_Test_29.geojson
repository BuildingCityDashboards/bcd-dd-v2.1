        "DevelopmentDescription" : "Construction of the Adamstown Railway Station, and transportation interchange including a park and ride facility and associated roads and access arrangements.  The development will consist of the construction of a 667m2 two-level train station of c.12.4m in height, with entrance level and platforms at ground floor level.  The station concourse will be provided at first floor level, and the proposed accommodation will consist of a ticket office (c.9.5m2), a Retail unit (c.39.8m2) and associated administration offices and toilet facilities (total area 51.3m2).  The development seeks to provide a double sided central island platform structure, in order to provide a turn back facility.  This results in a total central island platform of 191m in length by 9m wide.  A 3m wide platform of 197m in length is to be incorporated into the central island platform structure, in order to provide a turn back facility.  This results in a total central island platform length of 388m.  Immediately to the south of the existing rail line, a third platform of 182m in length by 4m wide will be constructed.  The development provides for the station for its first and second phase of operation as proposed by Iarnrod Eireann, the first being the use of the two existing tracks using the south platform and the southern face of the island platform.  It will be possible to use the turnback facility provided, when the track connections are in place.  The second phase will allow the suburban trains to use the two faces of the island platform and the turnback facility.  Access to platform level will be via stairs and lift.  The park and ride car park will be provided immediately to the north east of the proposed station building, and will be temporary in nature pending its probable incorporation into the buildings of Adamstown District Centre in accordance with the Adamstown Planning Scheme.  Barrier controlled access is being provided to some 300 car parking spaces, and a proprietary kiosk of c.9.5m2 is to be provided to allow the car park to be staffed as and when required.  Drop off facilities are to be provided, in tandem with bus waiting and pick up areas and taxi waiting and pick-up areas.  A sheltered waiting facility is to be provided in the bus pick up area.  100 bicycle parking spaces are to be provided in a shelter, located close to the main station entrance.  Access to the proposed development is to be off the distributor road network permitted under Planning Reg. Ref. SDZ04A/1.  Site development and landscape works also form part of this application.  This application is being made in accordance with the provisions of the Adamstown Planning Scheme 2003.  The lands fall entirely within the boundaries of Adamstown Strategic Development Zone as defined by Statutory Instrument No. 272 of 2001.",

Also the consequential relocation and retention of lift shaft internally, thereby avoiding direct entry to control tower.  The height of the lift shaft is increased by 1.5m.  The retention also incorporates necessary security arrangements by changing the use of the ground floor by the provision of office accommodation and reception at ground floor and slight increase in bar area and reduction in office space at first floor.  The application also includes the proposed use of the unroofed areas behind the perimeter parapet walling for air handling units and ventilation equipment.

Also the consequential relocation and retention of lift shaft internally, thereby avoiding direct entry to Control Tower.  The height of the lift shaft is increased by 1.5m.  The retention also incorporates necessary security arrangements by changing the use of the ground floor by the provision of office accommodation and reception at ground floor and slight increase in bar area and reduction in office space at first floor.  The application also includes the proposed use of the unrooofed areas behind the perimeter parapet walling for air handling units and ventilation equipment.
