        "DevelopmentDescription" : "PROTECTED STRUCTURE: Planning permission for development within the overall Grangegorman Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) of approx. 28.69 hectares.  The specific site of the proposed development is located on the western side of Grangegorman Upper bounded by Grangegorman Upper to the north and east, existing car parking to the south, and 'The Top House' (a protected structure) to the west at the former St. Brendan's Hospital. The development will consist of revisions to previously permitted development under DCC Planning reg. ref. 2114/09 and DCC Planning reg. ref. 3373/12 to now compromise the provision of a Primary Care Centre on a site of approx 1.062 hectares, which will entail works to the single storey (33.83m OD) Laundry building (a protected structure) of some 1,255 sq.m to facilitate the permitted medical related use of the Laundry building as a Primary Care Centre. The proposed development will also include the provision of a new 3 storey (37.825M OD) extension of 2,378 sq. m to the west of the Laundry building (ground floor 964 sq.m, first floor 702 sq. m, second floor 702 sq. m with a 10 sq. m enclosed stairwell at roof level (38.080M OD) {including a single storey element (29.25 M OD) situated to the west} all to include general practitioners consultation rooms, therapy rooms, treatment/consulting rooms, reception areas, and associated ancillary floorspace all connected to the Laundry building by a single storey (27.75M OD) entrance foyer area resulting in an overall Primary Care Centre of approx. 3,704 sq. m. In addition to the permitted works to the laundry building under DCC Planning reg. ref. 2114/09 the proposed revisions include;\r\n A) Provision of new internal opes in existing fabric to allow for general modifications to the permitted internal arrangement of spaces to provide sub-division of internal areas forming reception/waiting areas, meeting/consultation/surgery rooms, office space, canteen and other related ancillary spaces;\r\n B) Provision of new door in 4 no. existing opes previously identified for blocking up;\r\n C) Omission of 6 no. previously permitted new opes not now required; \r\n D) Re-arrangement of (already permitted) alterations to existing floor including reuse of existing parquet flooring to canteen, circulation and meeting room;\r\n E) Breaking out of external wall to the west elevation as well as internal wall and window opes to facilitate new entrance foyer to proposed 3 storey extension;\r\n F) Revisions to eastern elevation to allow for part render finish; incorporation of previously permitted 2 no. new opes and increase in height to match existing windows and increase in height of existing 2 no. doors to match height of existing opes; \r\nG) Alterations to mechanical and electrical services and plant;\r\n H) Revisions to permitted landscaping/lighting/attenuation and external arrangement and all ancillary site works.\r\n I) The provision of a new plant room of approx. 71 sq. m over the existing WC area internally to the existing building resulting in floorspace of 1,326 sq. m for the Laundry building; \r\nJ) Relocation of stone pier to junction of proposed pedestrian path and permitted Ivy Avenue.\r\nThe revisions to DCC Planning Reg. Ref. 3373/12 relate to the provision of a permanent pedestrian entrance and the temporary use of permitted service entrance to allow for its use by the Primary Care Centre from its opening until 2017 (from Grangegorman Upper). Construction access for the proposal will be from the North Circular Road. Permission is also sought for the provision of 50 no. Car parking spaces in a temporary location to the west of the laundry building pending the completion of building plot no. 4 as well as 21 no. cycle stands and all site development and landscape and drainage works (temporary and permanent), including new steps and ramps to connect to permitted Ivy Avenue (under planning reg. ref. 3373/12) boundary treatment, site lighting, attenuation, and security cameras, external access lift and all ancillary site works.\r\n",

The total development site area, accessed from Simmonscourt Road, is 1,762 square metres (sq.m.). The development will consist of the temporary change of use of the two storey, 1,088 sq.m gross floor space Sandymount Building from office use to education use (comprising a six classroom primary school with ancillary rooms and facilities including the yard to the rear) for a maximum period of three school years up until July 2017, and all ancillary site and landscaping works associated with this, including a new internal disability access lift. It should be noted that the Sandymount Building is permitted to be demolished and replaced with an office development as per Dublin City Council planning reg. ref. 2617/03 (An Bord Pleanala ref. 205688) to upgrade or replace various buildings on RDS lands. The demolition of the Sandymount Building and replacement works are due to be completed by 2019 (refer to extension of duration decision Reg.Ref. 2617/03/x1). There are no external changes proposed to the Sandymount Building, except for revisions to an external fire stairs, the blocking up of a first floor window on the southern facade, and 'School' signage on the southern facade adjacent to the existing vehicular entrance into the site to the east of the building. Vehicular access into the site will use the existing entrance on Simmonscourt Road to the east of the building. The proposal will also require a new pedestrian entrance to the west of the existing vehicular entrance. The new pedestrian gate will match existing railings. This constitutes works to a protected structure, namely the site boundary wall, railings, gates and gate piers of the RDS. Ancillary works will include provision of 6 staff car parking spaces, an external bin store, a bicycle stand, scooter racks/pods and a 1.8 metre high galvanised steel post and timber panel fencing to segregate the site boundary/outdoor play area from the RDS lands to the north, and with 1.8 metre high painted railings over low wall (to match existing railings) and a pedestrian gate, to segregate the outdoor play area from the staff parking area. A vehicular gate will be located in the new fencing at the rear of the staff parking area to maintain vehicular access through to RDS lands if required by the RDS.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "The proposed development will consist of the construction of 2 no. 50MVAr shunt reactance coil units within, and at the southern boundary of, the existing Poolbeg Generating station complex, which comprises the area of the existing Poolbeg 220 kV substation compound. Each 50 MVAr shunt reactance coil unit will comprise 3 no. cylindrical coils, with a diameter of approximately 3m, and a height of approximately 9m. Associated equipment and apparatus proposed will comprise 6 no. 220kV circuit breakers, 12 no. 220kV surge arrestors, 12 no. 220kV post insulators, 6 no. low level post insulators, 6 no. 220kV cable sealing ends, and 4 no. 15m high lightning monopoles. The proposed equipment will connect to the existing Poolbeg 220kV substation by way of underground cabling, and the installation of 2 no. proposed cable/GIS switchgear interface units, of approximately 6m height and 2.4m width on the southern elevation of the existing GIS substation building. Each 50MVAr shunt reactance coil unit will be sited on an area of approximately 252.2m2, enclosed by security fencing of approximately 2m height; in addition, the general area of the 2 no. proposed coil units and associated equipment and apparatus, of approximately 1,334.5m2, will be surrounded by an outer security fencing of approximately 2.6m height, including a vehicular access gate along its northern side; It is also proposed to construct a new security fence of approximately 2.6m height around the wider Poolbeg 220kV substation compound (and connecting into the existing boundary security fencing at the Poolbeg Generating Station complex), enclosing an area of approximately 18,666m2. This fence will include 2 no. vehicular access gates along its northern side. Vehicular access to the proposed development site will remain via the existing Poolbeg Generating Station entrance on Pigeon House Road. Ancillary works will include generally minor alterations to the existing internal road network, and drainage improvement works, including a new soakaway pit of approximately 25m2. The removal of existing trees within the overall Generating Station complex, covering an area of approximately 1185m2, is required to facilitate the proposed development. A section of an existing berm will be raised in height from approximately 2.6m to approximately 3.4m (approximately 40m in length).\r\n\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "RETENTION: Development 1:  Permanent retention of an existing two storey office building with a single storey walkway linking it to an existing clerical building to the east (total floor area 722sqm). This development was completed on foot of a temporary permission granted on 27.03.2009, Planning Ref. 5333/08. No intensification of use has occurred as the building accommodates the HR and Finance departments previously located elsewhere on the campus and which had to be relocated to facilities the new Cystic Fibrosis unit. The building was designed and built with a view to permanency. The fabric of the structure (steel frame with concrete floor slabs and external rain screen cladding) and the lifetime of the materials used make it suitable for permanent retention. \r\nDevelopment 2: Permanent retention of an existing three storey with rooftop plant room High Dependency Unit/Medical Assessment Unit building linked to the existing hospital on all three floors (total floor area 1857sqm). this development was completed on foot of a temporary permission granted on 27.02.2007, Planning Ref. 1029/07. The building is located in courtyard between the Ward Blocks on the southern side of the central vertical circulation. It provides essential clinical services to some of the highest risk patients within the hospital e.g pre and post transplant patients. The building provides critical pressured and filtered air supplies to reduce the infection risks to accommodated patients, ward facilities, nurses stations, day rooms, and treatment rooms for critically ill patients, with all necessary associated ancillary accommodation. The building was designed and built in a modular construction with a view to permanency. The fabric of the structure (steel frame with concrete floor slabs and external rain screen cladding) and the lifetime of the materials used make it suitable for permanent retention. Due to its courtyard location the HDU/MAU building is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity. \r\nDevelopment 3: Permanent retention of an existing Transit Lounge, (total floor area 197sqm), located at the rear of the Emergency Department, Planning Ref. 4252/06. The single storey extension that was built is not in compliance with the planning permission granted, which was for a two storey building. The Transit Lounge provides essential clinical services and accommodation for the adjacent Emergency Department. The building was designed and built with a view to permanency. The fabric of the structure (steel frame construction with external rain screen cladding) and the lifetime of the materials used make it suitable for permanent retention. No intensification of use has occurred as the building provides additional accommodation for the Emergency Department which was previously provided within the Department.  Due to its location behind the Emergency Department the Transit Lounge is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity. \r\nDevelopment 4: Permanent retention of an existing single storey Pharmacy Office Extension,  (total floor area 64sqm), beside the existing Pharmacy Unit and Oncology Building located at the Trim Road entrance, Planning Ref. 1841/07. A full planning permission for the Pharmacy building was granted at the time; however a 64sqm office extension to same was added.\r\nThe building was designed and built with a view to permanency. The fabric of the structure (steel frame with external profiled metal cladding) and the lifetime of the materials used make it suitable for permanent retention. No intensification of use has occurred as the building accommodates Pharmacy services which were previously located elsewhere in the hospital. Limited views of the development will be provided from locations outside the hospital campus. \r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "A five year permission for development on a site of 1,103 hectares at St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre, St. Stephen's Green West, Dublin 2. The development will consist of amendments to a  previous permission (Dublin City Council Reg.Ref.: 3208/10; An Bord Pleanála Reg.Ref. PL29S.237685 (the 'Parent Permission' or 'Scheme B')), to provide for two mutually exclusive, options. (The Parent Permission permits inter alia the construction of an 11 no. screen cinema complex on the existing rooftop car park on levels 8A and 9B, and the adjoining stair/ lift cores of the Shopping Centre with a stated gross floor area of 4,003 sq.m (The actual area illustrated on the corresponding drawings is 4,101 sq.m due to the omission of some 98 sq.m in calculations in the Parent Permission's statutory notices of a double height stair between Level o4 and Level 05 at Core 03, and also on the Lower Cinema Level at Core 04 and Core 09). The Options now sought will consist of two schemes that utilise an existing rooftop plant area within the cinema complex that had been identified previously in the Parent Permission for removal: \r\n1. Option 1 (Scheme C) proposes to utilise part of the existing rooftop parking area on Level 9B for the provision of plant and for the utilisation of part of an area of existing rooftop plant to be reconfigured to engineers' specification, resulting in the reduction of the permitted number of screens from 11 no. to 10 no. (a corresponding reduction of 139 no. seats (i.e. 1,851 no. seats to 1,712 no. seats); and \r\n2. Option 2 (Scheme D) proposes to utilise part of the existing rooftop parking area on Level 9B for the provision of plant and for the utilisation of an area of existing rooftop plant to be reconfigured to engineers' specification, resulting in the reduction of the permitted number of screens from 11 to 9 no. (a corresponding reduction of 239 no. seats (i.e. 1,851 no. seats to 1,612 no. seats)). Both Options arise in order to envelop the existing plant at rooftop level by the permitted cinema. In addition to the internal alterations proposed under the two Options, a timber baffle-screen is illustrated on the foyer of the permitted north-eastern elevation along South King Street to facilitate compliance with Condition no. 2 of the Parent Permission the subject of this proposed amendment application (Dublin City Council Reg.Ref.: 3208/10; An Bord Pleanála Reg.Ref.: PL29S.237685). The proposed gross floor area of the cinema under Option 1 is 4,068 sq.m and under Option 2 is 4,059 sq.m; representing a reduction of 33 sq.m and 42 sq.m respectively, from the permitted development (based on the corrected 4,101 sq.m figure). The development includes all associated ancillary works above and below ground . With the exception of the above proposed alterations, all other works permitted under the Parent Permission remain unaltered. Access and egress from the complex is proposed as previously permitted (i.e. via the main entrances to the Shopping Centre).\r\n",

The development consists of a single storey corridor and equipment wash room to the rear of the Endoscopy Unit (total floor area 185 sq.m). The Endoscopy Department Extension is a \"dirty corridor\" that permits the movement of used equipment from the Endoscopy Theatre to the washing facility. As such it is essential to the proper functioning of the Endoscopy unit which provides a critical clinical service to the hospital. The Endoscopy building is a sunken single storey structure located within a courtyard between Ward Block 7 and the Private Clinic and is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity. No intensification of use has occurred as the building accommodates an essential function within the Endoscopy Unit.\r\n- Development 2: Permanent retention of an existing intensive Care Unit Plant room. The development consists of a single storey plant room housing air conditioning plant for the Intensive Care Unit, (total floor area 42 sq.m), located on lower ground floor level in the courtyard directly adjacent to the Intensive Care Unit. The Intensive Care Unit plant room provides critical pressurised and filtered air supplies to reduce the infection risks and provide the safest environment to the accommodated patients. Due to its courtyard location the ICU Plant Room is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity.\r\n- Development 3: Permanent retention of an existing CSSD / Theatre Stores extension. The development consists of a single storey extension to the CSSD / Theatre Department, 86 sq.m approx. located at the east of the campus behind the energy centre. Due to its location behind the Energy Centre the CSSD / Theatre Stores extension is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity.\r\n- Development 4: Permanent retention of an existing UPS Electrical Plant Room for the Operating Theatres. The development consists of an elevated single storey plant room on the Radiology Department roof of 80 sq.m approx. providing emergency power to the Operating Theatres. No noise is generated by the UPS Electrical plant room as it provides stand-by power and not air handling. The UPS Electrical plant room is located at roof level of the upper ground floor behind another plant room and is not visible from the hospital ring road or the residential amenities in the vicinity.\r\n",

The development will include repairs and minor expansion to the surface of the concrete hardstand (1.7 hectares), together with incorporation of single storey portacabin building for security and welfare facility (72 sq.m), lighting, CCTV, vehicle management controls and signage, bus bay line markings, installation of drainage control infrastructure and alterations to existing boundary fencing at New Wapping Street entrance (to facilitate vehicle access and egress) and within the site to delineate coach park from remainder of site. The facility will only permit access to empty private coaches. The development will operate principally during daytime periods (0700 to 1900) to accommodate commuter and tourist coaches. However, the development will also occasionally operate during weekends and evening/night time periods for special events (sports, concerts etc). It is intended to utilise the former North Wall Freight Depot as a Coach Parking Facility  only until the lands are necessary for the construction of DART Underground, for which a Railway Order has been approved.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "RETENTION: Planning permission for development and for retention permission for development at this site known as Dakota Bar and Grill, 8/9 South William Street and 39/40 Drury Street, as well as the premises formerly known as Fashion Fair, also at 39/40 Drury Street, Dublin 2. The proposed development will consist of a change of use at first floor level of 39/40 Drury Street from wholesale fashion warehouse to licenced bar and restaurant; change of use at first floor level of 8/9 South William Street from offices to licenced bar and restaurant; a connecting outdoor terrace/licenced dining area at first floor level between 39/40 Drury Street and 8/9 South William Street (including an enclosed food hoist area linked to the kitchen at basement level); the change of use at second floor level of 39/40 Drury Street from wholesale fashion warehouse to toilets and ancillary office space to serve the first floor licenced bar and restaurant; and all associated site works and services. The new outdoor terrace/ licenced dining area on the first floor will be partially covered with a glazed canopy and will have a new 3.5 metre high wall within its northern boundary similar to the existing wall on its southern boundary. The main entrance to the first floor licenced bar and restaurant will be from 39/40 Drury Street (through the former Fashion Fair stairs and elevator lobby, formerly known as 40 Drury Street) with associated internal revisions (including levels and layout) and related external revisions to the ground floor shop front and signage of 39/40 Drury Street. Separate complementary revisions are also proposed to the adjacent shop front, signage and entrance into 39/40 Drury Street (Dakota Bar and Grill, formerly known as 39 Drury Street) and amendments to windows at first and second floor levels on Drury Street. A new fire access stairs from ground floor/street level on 8/9 South William Street to first floor, with an enclosed access area onto the first floor terrace, all part of the associated site works and services, will require the reopening of an original main entrance to 8/9 South William Street (previously blocked up) for use as a fire access door onto the street. This new access door at 8/9 South William Street will also serve as the disabled access to Dakota Bar and Grill and to the proposed first floor licenced bar and restaurant, via a new disabled access ramp on the ground floor through to the disabled access lift/ elevator lobby located in 39/40 Drury Street. Associated internal modifications will also include the relocation of the main basement to ground floor stairs to facilitate the new disabled access ramp on the ground floor. The development separately proposed for retention consists of an outdoor seating area at street level in front of 8/9 South William Street serving the existing ground floor licenced bar and restaurant. A 3-year retention permission for a seating area in the same location was granted on 22nd October 2008 (Reg. Ref 3741/08). This application seeks permanent retention permission for the same seating area, now to include 4 tables and 12 chairs surrounded by 1.5 metre high wind breakers (of glass and solid panels) in selected colour and a planter, and that this outdoor seating area may remain in use during the business hours of the licenced premises.\r\n",

        "DevelopmentDescription" : "PROTECTED STRUCTURE: Planning permission for development on a site of c. 1.2 hectares at No's 13-30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower, Dublin 2 (which currently accommodates ESB's Headquarters and associated structures) comprising most of a city block bounded by Fitzwilliam Street Lower to the west, Mount Street Upper r to the north, James's Street East to the east and Baggot Street Lower to the south. The development site includes various Twentieth Century ESB offices and ancillary buildings (dating from the 1940's to the 1980's) ranging in height from 4 to 7 storeys, along with eleven Protected Structures (No's. 12,29 and 30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower and No's. 55-62 Mount Street Upper - all 4 storey over lower ground floor). The main redevelopment relates to demolition and replacement of all the Twentieth Century office facilities (and a 1980's atrium structure) and this is accompanied by proposals for renovation and reuse of nine Georgian houses on the site and change of use for part of a tenth house (No. 12 Fitzwilliam Street Lower) all of which are Protected Structures. The combined redevelopment comprises a total of c.48,754 sq m and No's. 12 and 29 Fitzwilliam Street Lower (no internal works proposed to either, apart from protective works) comprise an additional c.1,153 sq m, giving an overall total of c. 49,907 sq m on the redeveloped site. The Main Development: The main development will consist of the demolition of all the Twentieth Century office buildings and atrium structure in their entirety (c.36,208 sq m) and their replacement with a new mixed-use development (c.45,767 sq m gross floor area) comprising office, cafe/ retail/ event space/ restaurant and ancillary uses, ranging in height from 4 to 7 storeys over a 2 level basement. This main development comprises offices (c. 36,917 sq m); event space/ retail/ non-retail service areas (c. 302 sq m) on a new pedestrian route leading through the site from Fitzwilliam Street Lower to James's Street East (aligned with Fitzwilliam Lane); a retail coffee shop/ restaurant (c. 148 sq m); ancillary plant and replacement of two existing rooftop telecommunications masts with one single rooftop telecommunications mast (c. +10m high). The basement levels will accommodate 440 No. bicycle spaces at lower ground level; office uses and cyclist changing facilities at level -1; and text labs at level -02; car spaces (110 No. - including service fleet and e-cars), plant, waste service and storage areas at -1 and -2. A further 30 No. bicycle spaces are provided at grade. Vehicular access to the basement and service areas will be provided from James's Street East. The building is designed to be adaptable and is capable of division into two buildings (Building A and B) operationally, or further sub-division. The development includes environmental improvement works to the adjacent public streets, including James's Street East. All proposed works affecting the public streets are subject to detailed agreement with the Roads and Traffic Department of Dublin City Council. The Protected Structures: In addition to the main development, ESB Commercial Properties Ltd is proposing the refurbishment and adaptive re-use of nine (of the eleven) Protected Structures within the development boundary (comprising in total c. 2,753 sq m).Three will be refurbished for continuing office use (No's 55 to 57 Mount Street Upper), four will change use from existing office to residential (No's 58 to 61 Mount Street Upper - providing eight apartments (4 No. 2-bed duplex and 4 No.3-bed triplex) and requiring the addition of external returns and balconies to their rear [but with an option to remain in office use should this be deemed more appropriate by Dublin City Council or An Bord Pleanála]); refurbishment of No's 30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower and 62 Mount Street Upper to provide three residential apartments (2 No. 2-bed and 1 No. 3-bed duplex and involving a new connection between No. 30 and 62 at ground, first, second and third floor levels, the removal of the existing stairs to No.62, alterations and repairs to the roof of No. 30 and provision of a new four storey circulation annex structure to the rear of No's 29, 30 and 62). The proposal involves protective works to No.12 Fitzwilliam Street Lower (a Protected Structure) during the demolition and redevelopment and permission for change of use of the ground floor and lower ground floor of No.12 (from residential to commercial/ office). The development of the Protected Structures also involves provision of a platform lift from lower ground to street level to provide universal access (beside No. 61 Mount Street Upper); breaking through all lower ground under-stairs porches along Mount Street Upper to create a continuous walkway and paving to that area, and removal/ demolition of a 1980's atrium structure (c. 821 sq m) and other linkages attached to the rear of No's 55 to 62 Mount Street Upper and No's 29/30 Fitzwilliam Street Lower (all Protected Structures) and subsequent repair of the rear facade of these buildings including repair/ restoration of brickwork, render and windows. Overall proposed area of development to Protected Structures with 'returns' is c. 2,987 sq m. (excluding the existing floorspace of No's 12 (c.540 sq m) and 29 (c.613 sq m) Fitzwilliam Street Lower (no internal works proposed), which will be protected as necessary during the redevelopment. The overall development will also include the provision of private, semi-private and public open spaces in the form of terraces, balconies, garden areas including sunken courtyard gardens, roof terraces, and walkways and a new public plaza, hard and soft landscaping changes ( including around boundary), signage and flagpoles, changes in level, substations, plant, ground and air source heating and all other associated site excavation, safety hoardings and site development works above and below ground.

The proposed new three storey unit, which will be located facing on to Beneavin Road is designed to fully comply with the latest Nursing Home Care Standards as set out under HIQA accommodation guidelines and meet the latest thinking in Dementia Care Provision.  A small single-storey section of the existing Beneavin Lodge next to the existing building entrance will be demolished. The scheme will include the conversion of an existing, vacant, assisted living single-storey building to the east of the site to become a specially designed social activity with customised internal and external recreational facilities and services provided for the specific use of the Proposed New Dementia Wing. To accommodate this proposal the existing site entrance from Beneavin Road will be closed off and relocated further to the east of the site at the rear of the existing, vacant assisted living building and a new one way system adopted to ensure a coherent strategy for access, drop off, additional parking (including Disabled Parking and cycle parking) to all units within the Beneavin Lodge part of the campus, and involves the removal of one tree. There will be a provision for 39 cars (2 for disabled use) and 12 cycles in a covered stand. Additionally, the March 2012 planning approval (ref. 2060/12) will have minor modifications to provide a new entrance at the easterly end of the approved 4-storey block to the south of the site adjacent to the playing fields. Included in the proposal will be the provision of a quality landscaping scheme, new boundary walling and railings, and all drainage works to comply with current  Dublin City Council standards.\r\n",
