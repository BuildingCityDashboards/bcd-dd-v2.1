        "DevelopmentDescription" : "The application seeks permission to amend a previous permission (Dublin City Council Reg. Ref. 3813/07) that itself amended Reg. Ref. 5616/05 on a smaller site of 0.1024 hectares (called up in the Statutory Notices as no. 25 (part of) to No. 31 York Street and Proud's Lane, Dublin 2) for which Dublin City Council issued an Extension of Duration of Permission (under Reg. ref. 5616/05/x1 on 1st February 2011) to 22nd February 2016. \r\n\r\nPermission Reg. Ref 5616/05 and Reg. Ref 3813/07 collectively permit the construction of a 6 no. storey mixed use building over 4 no. basement levels, and ancillary works on part of this site. The permissions facilitated the provision of the National Surgical Training Centre and a multi-purpose sports hall related activities below ground level. The above floors accommodated a variety of educational, training and commercial uses.\r\n\r\nDevelopment on foot of those permissions commenced, comprising site excavation and the construction of basement foundations and retaining walls. Those constructed elements of the permitted development will be modified as appropriate to facilitate their incorporation into the current proposal.\r\n\r\nThe proposed development will consist of the redesign of the permitted building to develop a six storey educational and medical  training facility over 4 no. basement levels and sub-basement (water tanks and lift pits) accommodating inter alia: multi-purpose sports facilities with related activities and prayer rooms at Basement Levels - 4 and -3; plant room and lower level of raked auditorium including support areas at Basement level -2; auditorium and related break-outs areas and support facilities at Basement Level -1; student foyer area, services desk area, café,kitchen, and ancillary loading area at Ground Floor Level; with 5 no. storeys of educational training and academic support facilities above ground comprising inter alia; library study space; tutorial rooms; practical clinical surgical skills' rooms; other associated ancillary educational facilities; a projecting window at first floor level; the provision of 100 no. bicycle spaces; development of a new electricity substation and plant; external terrace at ground floor level; set back at fifth floor level on the York Street elevation; the relocation of a 375mm public sewer ( with invert levels from 8.57m OD to 8.24OD Malin Head) from underneath the site to Cuffe Street via Cuffe lane; and all associated ancillary works above and below ground including landscape and boundary treatments. An enclosed plant area will be located at 5th floor level, with additional rooftop plant. In addition, the development will consist of the demolition of a security hut (16.5sqm) in the Ardilaun centre; the erection of the College Logo and associated signage on the northern elevation to York Street and the reconfiguration of the Ardilaun Centre's parking provision, reducing the current total number of spaces from 103 No. spaces to 59 no. spaces of which 15 no. spaces will be attributed to the proposed building. The total floor area of the building will increase from the 7,519sqm permitted to 11,175sqm in the current proposal.\r\n",

The main implication is that the side elevation of no 28 (previously proposed to be hidden) will now be in public view from Pearse Street and Spring Garden Lane. The alterations  proposed are intended to address this architectural and urban issue, and they are; (i) the omission of the kitchen balcony -type extensions and the cleaning of the existing pebbledash render to the gable wall, (ii) the insertion of 2 new sash windows in the gable wall (4 were proposed previously), (iii) the provision of a coloured, rendered finish to the rear extension (previously unseen), (iv) the removal of the pebbledash at the ground floor level of the gable wall to expose the existing brick and stone finish, (v) the provision of a horizontal comice in white concrete to the side elevation to highlight the position of the main entrance at the new extension (previously unseen) (vi) the provision of a low white concrete wall between the side entrance path and the adjoining site (previously unnecessary) and (vii) the provision of a textured rendered finish to the rear portion of the ground floor wall adjacent to 28A (previously unseen). The new signage will consist of 3.24 sqm of traditional signboard to the Pearse Street frontage and 2.89 sqm of signage in white concrete at the main entrance on the side elevation.\r\n",

The alterations are consequent to the postponement in construction of the proposed new adjoining building at 28A and 29 Pearse Street, Dublin 2 (DCC reg ref 2772/07); this building was to have been built in tandem with no 28 (now under construction). The main implication is that the side elevation of no 28 (previously proposed to be hidden) will now be in public view from Pearse Street and Spring Garden Lane. The alterations proposed are intended to address this architectural and urban issue, and they are; (i) the omission of the kitchen 'balcony-type' extensions and the cleaning of the existing pebbledash render to the gable wall, (ii) the insertion of 2 new sash windows in the gable wall ( 4 were proposed previously), (iii) the provision of a coloured, rendered finish to the rear extension previously unseen), (iv) the removal of the pebbledash at the ground floor level of the gable wall to expose the existing brick and stone finish, (v) the provision of a horizontal comice in white concrete to the side elevation to highlight the provision of the main entrance at the new extension (previously unseen)(vi) the provision of a low white concrete wall between the side entrance path and the adjoining site (previously unnecessary) and (vii) the provision of a textured rendered finish to the rear portion of the ground floor wall adjacent to 28A (previously unseen). The new signage will consist of 3.24sqm of traditional signboard to the Pearse Street frontage and 2.89 sqm of signage in white concrete at the main entrance on the side elevation.\r\n",

The development separately proposed for retention consists of a glass-roofed lean-to canopy, with a proprietary steel colonnade, on a raised tiled platform of approximately 38.9 square metres in area, bounded by a handrail, with steps up to the platform from the car park/delivery/storage area, all located at the northern side of the premises. This structure is used by the patrons of the Odeon Bar and Grill as an outdoor standing/seating area and will be used as a disabled access route into the bar. The top height of the mono-pitch glass canopy is approximately 5.7 metres from ground level and it covers the platform area, which will include the disabled-access platform lift. The development proposed for retention also includes internal storage of approximately 21 square metres at basement level underneath the new platform. This new basement storage includes a lift shaft area for the proposed external disabled-access platform lift mechanism, as well as space for a glass bottle crusher to facilitate on site recycling of the Bar's glass/bottles. This additional basement storage area is accessed from the existing car park/delivery/storage area via a concrete stairs, as well as from a keg hatch in the northern side wall of the new platform structure. A blocked-up opening at basement level in the property's original northern side wall has been reopened to connect this additional storage area through to the property's existing basement storage areas. The development proposed for retention also comprises ancillary works including: a new 1.2 metres wide pedestrian entrance gate from Harcourt Street into the car park/delivery/storage area, with a new section of railing on stone plinth between the existing vehicular gate and the new pedestrian gate which matches the materials of the existing contemporary boundary treatment onto Harcourt Street; the northern end of the building's front steps onto Harcourt Street have been cut back and detailed to symmetrically match the existing arrangement at southern end of the steps (similar to that granted permission as part of Registry Reference 3161/08); a new opening has been cut into the northern side wall of the premises (similar to that granted permission as part of Registry Reference 3161/08) which allows circulation from the front portico area into the new canopy area to the side; a new vertical striped paint effect to the wall and ceiling of the front portico; the re-levelling and resurfacing of the car park/delivery/storage area with cobble-lock paving so the entire car park/delivery/storage area is level with the entrance onto Harcourt Street; a new low planter around the western, northern and eastern boundaries of the car/park/delivery/storage area; and all other ancillary works.\r\n",
