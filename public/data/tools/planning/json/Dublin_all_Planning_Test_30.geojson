It is proposed that marketing suite / Information Centre use would apply to the three residential units for a period of 3 years only after which time the approved use of the units would revert to residential.  Permission is also sought for the retention of internal alterations including the omission of the first floor of No. 1 Castlegate Park: this creates a double height unit in this location; opening the southern wall of the first floor of No. 49 Castlegate Wall.  This alteration has the effect of creating a mezzanine level in the double height unit proposed in No. 1 Castlegate Park; the installation of a new stairway to access the resultant mezzanine level; opening of a connecting doorway at ground floor level between 49 and 43 Castlegate Way; provision of a fire resistant stud partition to block off the stairway between ground and first floors of 43 Castlegate Way; opening of a wall and provision of a fire protected lobby at first floor level of 49 Castlegate Way; other alterations to the interior accommodation so as to provide accessible toilet facilities, offices, a meeting room, a kitchenette, a catering area, and exhibition areas.  In addition external alterations and extensions to the units are also proposed for retention including the addition of exterior cladding, timber louvers, two lobby extensions of c.11.1sq.m. each.  Upon cessation of the temporary change of use, all of the additions and alterations will be removed and the finished units will be built in accordance with the plans permitted under Planning Reg. Ref. SDZ04A/1.  It is proposed to erect two advertising signs on the R120 Lock Road, one north and one south of the entrance to Castlegate Way.  Both advertising signs will be 6.6m high, and will carry 2 no. panels of c.9.58sq.m. each arranged in a 'V' formation.  One side of each sign will also carry an electronically controlled LED panel with details of the opening hours of the marketing suite and Adamstown Information Centre.  Permission is also sought for 2 no. external signs attached to the marketing suite and Adamstown Information Centre building.  On the western elevation a 3m high x 3.6m wide panel will carry back-lit stainless steel letters and the Adamstown Castle logo.
