Plot B (South) - Extension to the existing shopping centre at Level 3 with a total gross floor area of 5,684sq.m. and comprising a retail unit and associated ancillary accommodation; the proposed new retail unit will incorporate the existing units (U307 & U307A) totalling 415sq.m. to gain access to the existing mall at Level 3; the southern extension will result in the removal of 111 parking spaces and will have a parapet height of 12.3 metres to 13.5 metres above existing ground level at the southern elevation.  Permission is also sought for all associated site and development works associated with the above developments including revisions to public realm, revisions to roads layout and footpaths, hard and soft landscaping, ESB substation and building mounted signage; the development proposed results in a net increase in parking associated with The Square of 432 spaces.\r\n",

The altered building will include an administration area with office space of 2,225sq.m. As a result, permitted elevations will be altered and the number of flues reduced from 9 to 5.

The new buildings will be in the range of 6.362 m - 8.689 m high and to a range of finished floor levels between 68.5m and 69.5m OD; a total of 12 new flues (each 15m high) are proposed; provision of associated plant to include sprinkler tank (670m3) and pump room (69sq.m), external generators (20 no.)

This Masterplan includes the development of a neighbourhood recreational hub providing a wide range of both active and passive recreational facilities in Jobstown Park. It is planned that these facilities can be provided on a phased basis, over the coming years. Emphasis has been given to the development of the widest possible range of outdoor sports and recreational facilities including a 4 no. All-Weather 5-a-side pitches, 400m Athletics Track, Skatepark, Childrens’ Playground, Adult Tone Zone, etc. to complement the indoor facilities, currently available in Tallaght Leisure Centre and those already in the Park. The future environmental and financial sustainability of the park proposals, together with the need to meet the specific future recreational needs of the population of Jobstown and the wider Tallaght area, have been the main guiding principles in the overall Park Design. The proposal also includes the future provision of wind turbines on the site, which can be developed in the future if deemed economically viable. Future pedestrian and cycle linkages from this central recreational hub by way of a green bridge across the Outer Ring Road extending to the Luas - Saggart and Tallaght Lines, Tallaght Town Centre/ Zip Project etc. are also provided for. All on a site of approximately 27 acres / 11.5 hectares as indicated on site location drawing no. PLS 1763 – 01d\r\nThe first phase of the park development will involve the construction this year of 4 no. floodlit five-a-side (Astro-type) all-weather pitches.

The scheme provides for: (a) leisure arena (c.10,567sq.m gross) designed for international standard ice related activities but also allowing the flexibility for other similar type events with the capacity to seat up to 2,500 persons, associated service, storage and changing facilities. A dance studio, gym and local community office are provided at ground level with direct access from the east-west street. A multi-functional open area is provided immediately east of the arena to accommodate occasional events, activities and coach parking; (b) a 2-3 storey extension to the existing Centre (c.51,545sq.m gross) providing for mixed leisure and entertainment units (c.4,217sq.m gross), food/beverage units (c.4,535sq.m gross), retail units (c.29,732sq.m gross) and all ancillary space, circulation areas (c.12,023sq.m gross) and a basement service area (c.1,038sq.m gross). The main retail area will be anchored by 2 stores over three floors (comprising a total of c.13,993sq.m gross) located on either side of the public plaza. A local Garda office and affordable retail units are also provided in the main retail area; (c) a central public plaza fronting onto the east-west street covered with a large glass canopy in the form of a curved gridshell structure. This structure will be the tallest part of the proposal at a height of c.20m above street level. The food/beverage units are located around the Plaza at both ground and first floor levels; (d) a multi-storey car park over 4 levels (c.1,820 spaces with an area of c.53,611sq.m) located east of the extension area and north of the leisure arena. 18 mobility impaired surface spaces, approximately 180 cycle spaces and bus/taxi set down areas on the east-west street. Approximately 1,679sq.m of existing gross floorspace is to be removed/demolished over ground and first floor to facilitate the extension.  The proposal includes all associated service yards, plant and equipment, electricity substations, all utility connections and works, street lighting, signage, landscaping and boundary treatments. The proposal includes the construction of new toucan crossing points for pedestrians and cyclists at the western end of the east-west street to provide safe connection to the existing footpath and cycle network on Ascail an Life (ring road around the Centre). A new roundabout is also proposed at the entrance to the multi-storey car park on the eastern boundary. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) and a Natura Impact Statement (NIS) are submitted with this application. \r\n",
